elon_speeches.txt : personally scraped elon text
elon_musk_speeches.txt: taken from shitelonsays.com (seems site is dead now; took from https://github.com/berpj/datasets/blob/master/speeches/elon_musk_speeches.txt)

## Steps

1. Data Collection:

Web scraping: Collect text data from Elon Musk's tweets, interviews, and articles.
Video/Audio processing: Gather video and audio content featuring Elon Musk.

UPDATE: Seems some sites have blockers in place which makes it hard to scrape. Will paste the given transcripts into a txt file and then write a script to scrape the relevant parts in which Elon speaks. 


2. Data Processing:

Text data: Clean and preprocess the scraped text data.
Audio/Video processing:
a. Transcribe audio to text.
b. Perform speaker diarization to isolate Elon Musk's speech.
c. Extract quotes and statements made by Elon Musk.


3. Create Embeddings:

Choose an embedding model (e.g., OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002).
Generate embeddings for all collected text data.


4. Set up Vector Store:

Choose a vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, or Faiss).
Store the embeddings in the vector database.


5. Implement RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):

Set up an LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5 or GPT-4).
Implement a retrieval mechanism to fetch relevant context from the vector store.
Design a prompt template that incorporates the retrieved context.


6. Fine-tune the LLM:

Prepare a dataset using Elon Musk's statements.
Fine-tune the LLM to better emulate Elon Musk's speech patterns and knowledge.


7. Develop the API:

Create a FastAPI or Flask application to serve the AI model.
Implement endpoints for querying the model and retrieving responses.


8. Deployment:

Set up a cloud environment (AWS or Azure).
Deploy the application and necessary services.

9. Additional Steps:
- Would like to create a TTS system in which the outputted answer is spoken in an Elon-like voice
- Purely for educational purposes only


Testing and Iteration:

Test the deployed system thoroughly.
Gather feedback and iterate on the model and application as needed.
