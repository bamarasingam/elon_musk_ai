      "Hello, everyone. My apologies for the late start. We unfortunately had a massive distributed denial of service attack against our servers and saturated all of our data lines, like basically hundreds of gigabits of data were saturated.\n",
      "We think we've overcome most of that, and so it's now time to proceed. But as this massive attack illustrates, there's a lot of opposition to people just hearing what President Trump has to say. And so, but I'm honored to have this conversation.\n",
      "I want to emphasize it's a conversation, and it's really intended to just get a feel for what Donald Trump is just like in a conversation. It's hard to catch a vibe about someone if you just don't hear them talk in a normal way. And when there's an adversarial interview, like no one's themselves in an adversarial interview.\n",
      "So, and this is really aimed at kind of open-minded, independent voters who are just trying to make up their mind. And so you can understand like, what is it just like to have a conversation? So, honored to, Donald, great to speak.\n",
      "We had a great conversation yesterday. As you mentioned yesterday, if we could just record that conversation and post it, it would have been excellent. And I hope we can have something like that today.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Well, thank you. Well, maybe we could start off with, I mean, the assassination attempt, which was an incredible thing. And I have to say that your actions after that assassination attempt were inspiring. Instead of shying away from things, instead of ducking down, you were pumping your fist in the air and saying, fight, fight, fight.\n",
      "And I think that's, I mean, the president of the United States represents America. And I think that is America, that is strength under fire. And so that's a big, part of the reason why I was excited to endorse you as the president of the United States for having another term here is that was just incredibly inspiring.\n",
      "But I mean, what was it like for you?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Not pleasant.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Much blood.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I mean, maybe it's a sign. Maybe that's a sign, you know.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "You highlighted a serious issue at that moment. That's right. The bullet, you know, hit your ear.\n",
      "But, you know, missed your head.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Well, I mean, that's clearly, you know, he was very competent in taking that shot to stop the attempted assassination. But I mean, there does seem to be, I mean, some pretty significant failings elsewhere in the system. Like, there's just no way that, like, how on earth does a shooter get on a roof 130 yards away?\n",
      "That seems crazy. I think most people are wondering how on earth could such a thing happen.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I mean, it's like, I'm just, I guess, I mean, for my part, and I think probably many members of the public are wondering how the heck are, you know, basically people wandering by pointing out there's a guy on the roof with a gun. Yeah. They're seeing it, but somehow it's not being addressed.\n",
      "That does seem crazy.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, it's not a tough shot.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I mean, looking at the aerial views, that building would be, like, the number one spot for a sniper. I mean, it's like, if you were to pick, like, what is the favorite, what if you, so if the goal is to assassinate, what's your favorite spot? That building.\n",
      "You're right. That building would be number one.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's like, you couldn't ask for a better location. It's like, number one.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "But he totally would have hit if you hadn't turned your head, so like, you know, there was a, it was a very near thing.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Exactly.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "You'd be talking to me from another realm, perhaps.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Well, it was, I think your actions in the heat of fire, and, you know, like what I find admirable there was that you can't fake bravery under such circumstances. The courage is instinctual or it is not. It's not a rehearsed action.\n",
      "And so I just want to say that I think a lot of people admire your courage under fire there. And yeah, so...\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It was a terrible thing, but it was incredibly moving, yeah. Well, and I mean, speaking of the sort of slide that got you to turn, that saved your life really, was the illegal immigration slide. Maybe this is worth talking about, about that.\n",
      "It was, it was. That slide, that slide saved your life.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I mean, that's a great one. Saved by illegal immigration.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Well, what were you about to say about illegal immigration before you were rudely interrupted?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, so rudely interrupted by an assassination attempt.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Some people have no manners.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Well, I mean, would it be accurate to say that you're supportive of legal immigration, but we obviously need to shut down illegal immigration and especially unvetted illegal immigration because, you know, and that's not the same as saying that everyone who's an illegal immigrant is bad. In fact, I think most people who are illegal immigrants are actually good, but you can't tell the difference unless there's a solid vetting of who comes across the border. Does that actually represent your position?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, no, I think it is essential to have a secure border. I mean, you're really not a country unless you have a secure border.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, absolutely, secure elections. And so it's just essential to have a real border, or we can't function as a country. And our central services are being overwhelmed in a lot of cities.\n",
      "But as we were talking about earlier, I think having a legal immigration process that is smooth and efficient and done well, and I'm speaking as someone who is a legal immigrant, and I think that, I mean, like one way to think of it is who do you want on your team? Like who do you want on Team America? And I think we wanna just say, okay, we wanna let in people who are gonna be great contributors to our society and to our economy, and who do you want on the team?\n",
      "And it's not to say that, like in my opinion, actually, I'd say like probably most of the illegal immigrants actually are good, hardworking people. That's my opinion. But some are not.\n",
      "And you just have this sort of adverse selection process where if somebody has a career in theft or robbery, I don't understand what's taken them so long to get here because we're in such a target-rich environment. I mean, why aren't more people who have a career in bad things coming here sooner? Because it's, I mean, it's a piece of cake to go rob houses in L.A. or New York compared to other parts of the world. And in a lot of places in America, if you try to stop the person who's robbing you, you'll be arrested, so it's not fair.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's simply not working. No, it's horrible. Whether it's a question of intention or competence, either way, we don't have a secure border and we have people streaming over like it looks like a World War Z zombie apocalypse at times.\n",
      "And, you know, sometimes you gotta sort of wonder, like, is it real or not? You know, because you see things and you're like, is it real? So I went to the border at Eagle Pass and I saw for myself in Texas.\n",
      "And I was like, okay, it's real. I'm like seeing this in real time. I actually posted the video, like just live.\n",
      "I just flew there one day and just to see, hey, is this made up or real? And I'm just seeing people stream across the border. And I have to say, you know, at least the people that I saw did not look friendly.\n",
      "You know, so people can look at my video and say, hey, you know, these people look friendly. They don't look super friendly, so...\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, no, no. We have 20 million people in the border.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, I think this, frankly, I think this is a fundamental existential issue for the United States. And if we have another four more years of open borders, and it's gonna be even worse, with another four more years, it's gonna be even worse than it's been for the past three and a half years. I'm not sure we've got a country.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "This is a super important point. Like, people, it's like, well, basically, when I went down there, I was like, well, where are people from? It's like almost no one was from Mexico.\n",
      "No, Mexico less than the Earth. It's just the border with Mexico, but the people coming in, it's Earth, the rest of Earth. And America is only, you know, about 4 or 5% of the population of Earth. It would only take a few percent of the rest of Earth to overwhelm everything in the world.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's just an everywhere on Earth thing, and it's just not possible for the United States to absorb everyone from Earth, or even a few percent of the rest of Earth. It's just not possible.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, I mean, they just took him out back behind the shed and basically shot him.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, I think you're making an excellent point here, which is that when other countries that are thinking about invading or doing bad things, when they're thinking about that, they're thinking about, okay, what's the American president gonna do? And do they fear the American president? Or is there someone they do not respect and do not fear?\n",
      "And I think they would rightfully be, I mean, look at the footage of the assassination. They're like, okay, President Trump is like, don't mess with me. I mean, that's like, whereas I think people are not gonna be, and they obviously have not been at all intimidated by Biden.\n",
      "And they certainly will not be intimidated by Kamala. And you have to really think about it in the context of global security. That if the American president is someone that like evil dictators are scared of, that makes a huge difference to the security of the world.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, it doesn't make any sense. It's like, it's inconsistent, certainly. But I mean, I think it's just worth emphasizing to listeners that the immense importance of whether the United States president is intimidating or not intimidating and how much that matters to global security.\n",
      "Because there's some real tough characters out there. And if they don't think the American president is tough, they will do what they wanna do. I know every one of them.\n",
      "And that puts the whole world in danger.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Those were some epic tweets, by the way.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yes, I mean, it's because people like Kim Jong-un, they respond to strength, not weakness.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I think you're right. I think people underrate the risk of World War III. And it's just, when looking at the risk of global thermonuclear warfare, it's game over for humanity.\n",
      "And it's something that people have, I think after the end of the Cold War, people have become complacent about, but they actually have forgotten that there are currently a lot of nuclear missiles that have targeting parameters for the United States and other countries.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "No, they could not.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yes, absolutely.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, a lot of people just don't understand where inflation comes from. Inflation comes from government overspending because the checks never bounce when it's written by the government. So if the government spends far more than it brings in, that increases the money supply.\n",
      "And if the money supply increases faster than the rate of goods and services, that's inflation. So really, we need to reduce our government spending and we need to re-examine. I think we need like a government efficiency commission to say like, hey, where are we spending money that's sensible, where is it not sensible?\n",
      "And we need to live within our means. We're currently adding, I think a trillion dollars to the deficit every, roughly every hundred days. And the interest payments on the national debt have now exceeded the defense budget.\n",
      "It's on the order of a trillion dollars.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And it keeps growing.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Sure. Well, just going back to this basic thing, which is that people try to make it sound complicated, but it's not, but inflation is caused by government overspending. Would you agree that we need to take a look at government spending and have, perhaps, a government efficiency commission that just tries to make the spending sensible and so that the country lives within its means, just like a person does?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Multiply it by a million. Yeah, the numbers are astronomical.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Well, I mean, if, so, I mean, I mean, I think it would be great to just have a government efficiency commission that takes a look at these things and just ensures that the taxpayer money, to the taxpayers' hard-earned money is spent in a good way. And I'd be happy to help out on such a commission.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "If it were formed.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Well, I'd be happy to help out.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, well, it's just from government overspending and not just not spending taxpayer money effectively. And having, you know, just like so many departments, you can't even name them all. And what Malay is doing is, you know, he's cutting government spending.\n",
      "He's simplifying things. He's putting in regulations that make sense. And Argentina overnight is experiencing a giant improvement in prosperity.\n",
      "But it's also a lesson for the United States, which is that Argentina used to be one of the most prosperous countries in the world. You know, I think in the 30s, 40s. And because of bad government policy, it ruined the country.\n",
      "And if you take Venezuela, for example, Venezuela should be incredibly prosperous. They have, you know, phenomenal reserves of everything, oil, everything. And it should be prosperous.\n",
      "But if the government's wrong, it impoverishes the people. And so I think we should not be complacent in the United States and thinking that and taking our prosperity for granted, because with bad government policy, we can run the country into the ground. And that's just something people should bear in mind.\n",
      "Don't take prosperity for granted.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah. I think you're making a good point in that if the states have to, if each individual, if each state has to compete against other states, then people will naturally move to states where it's better.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Sure, yeah. No, but I mean, I mean, some of these governors are doing so badly. I mean, they got so many people moving out of their state, they should get U-Haul Salesman of the Year Award because they're driving so much U-Haul.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's just people moving out.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I mean, I think the thing that's, the only thing that's gonna force some of these states to change is if they risk bankruptcy and they're not getting bailed out by the federal government.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "That's the only thing that's gonna get them changed.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Well, I think that, I mean, that larger point here too, as you're saying, you know, a lot of people are concerned about the economy. A lot of people are concerned about inflation. And inflation is effectively a tax on people that save money and for people that are working day to day.\n",
      "It's just a form of taxation. And if we can solve the government spending problem, we'll solve the inflation problem, which means people will have a better standard of living. And that's a really big deal.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I think it really just comes, like I said, I think it just comes down to really, I guess really two things, which is, is that if you solve government overspending, you solve inflation, which improves living standards of the average person. And then if you deregulate, like have sensible regulations, because a lot of the regulations are nonsensical and cause the cost to be extreme for no reason. But unless you've got effective deregulation, like Reagan did a great job on deregulation in the 80s, but it's been 40 years since we haven't had anyone really, I mean, during your administration, we made some progress, but I think there's an opportunity to make, I think, radical progress with sensible regulation.\n",
      "And if you, those two things, yeah. Those are the big deals.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I should probably say something about like, you know, maybe my views on, you know, climate change and oil and gas, because I think I'm probably different from what most people would assume.\n",
      "Because my views are actually pretty, I think moderate in this regard, which is that I don't think we should vilify the oil and gas industry and the people that have worked very hard in those industries to provide the necessary energy to support the economy. And if we were to stop using oil and gas right now, we would all be starving and the economy would collapse. So it's, you know, I don't think it's right to sort of vilify the oil and gas industry.\n",
      "And I, you know, the world has a certain demand for oil and gas and it's probably better if the United States provides that than some other countries. And it would help with prosperity in the US. And at the same time, obviously my view is like, we do over time wanna move to a sustainable energy economy because eventually you do run out of, I mean, you run out of oil and gas.\n",
      "It's not there, it's not infinite. And there is some risk. I think it's not, the risk is not as high as, you know, a lot of people say it is with respect to global warming.\n",
      "But I think if you just keep increasing the cost per million in the atmosphere long enough, eventually it actually simply gets uncomfortable to breathe. People don't realize this. If you go past a thousand parts per million of CO2, you start getting headaches and nausea.\n",
      "And so we're now in the sort of 400 range. We're adding, I think about roughly two parts per million per year. So, I mean, it still gives us, so what it means is like, we still have quite a bit of time, but so there's not like, we don't need to rush and we don't need to like, you know, stop farmers from farming or, you know, prevent people from having steaks or basic stuff like that.\n",
      "Like leave the farmers alone.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah. Well, I mean, my estimate would be, you know, a little more aggressive than that, but it's not the sort of like, we're all gonna die in five years stuff. That's obviously BS.\n",
      "But I mean, my view is like, if you just look at sort of the parts per million that increments every year, you know, you get sort of two or three parts per million every year of CO2. I mean, I think some of that, it's problematic if it accelerates, if you start going from two or three to say five. And then there may be some situations where you get a step change increase in the CO2.\n",
      "And I think we don't wanna get too close to 1000 PPM because like that's actually makes it uncomfortable to breathe. Like just existing in 1000 PPM CO2 is uncomfortable. That's like a, that's considered like an industrial hazard.\n",
      "Just so it's, you know, that's actually, you start getting headaches and stuff. So it's even without global warming, it's not comfortable to live. So you don't wanna get too close to that.\n",
      "But I mean, I think we've got, I think we wanna just move over. And like if, I don't know, 50 to 100 years from now, we're, I don't know, mostly sustainable. I think that'll probably be okay.\n",
      "So it's not like the house is on fire immediately, but I think it is something we need to move towards. And on, you know, on balance, it's probably better to move there faster than slower. But like I said, without vilifying the oil and gas industry and without causing hardship in the short term, I think this can be done with without, you know, people can still have, you know, a stake and they can still drive gasoline cars.\n",
      "And this, you know, it's okay. It's like, it's not, I don't think we should vilify people first, but I think we should just generally lean in the direction of sustainability. And I actually think solar is gonna be a majority of earth's energy generation in the future.\n",
      "And it's certainly trending that way. And so you get the solar power, mind that with batteries. So because obviously the sun doesn't shine at night and then you use that to charge the electric cars and you have a long-term sustainable solution.\n",
      "And, you know, that's what Tesla is trying to move things towards. And I think we've made a lot of progress in that regard. But when you look at our cars, like we don't believe that environmentalism, that caring about the environment should mean that you have to suffer.\n",
      "So we make sure that our cars are beautiful, that they drive well, that they're fast, they're, you know, sexy. I mean, they're cool. In fact, literally, I mean, the sexy joke, Model S, Model 3, Model X and Y spells out sexy.\n",
      "It's probably the most expensive joke out there. But I, you know, I just, I don't know, I like cheesy humor, you know? So, but I'm a big fan of like, let's have an inspiring future and let's work towards, you know, a better future.\n",
      "And we can do so without demonizing people. Right, I'm okay.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, and actually, there's the bad side of nuclear, which is a nuclear war, very bad side. But there's also, I think, nuclear electricity generation is underrated. And it's actually, you know, people have this fear of nuclear electricity generation, but it's actually one of the safest forms of electricity generation.\n",
      "It's just a huge misunderstanding. And if you look at the injuries and deaths caused by, say, I mean, I'm not gonna try to pick on coal mining, but just any kind of mining operation. And there's a certain number of injuries and deaths per year.\n",
      "I mean, you compare that to nuclear, nuclear is actually way better. So it's underrated as an electricity source. And I think it's something that's worth reconsidering, but there's so much regulation that people can't get it done.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "No, that's not true.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's the basics. It's actually not that bad. So like after Fukushima happened in Japan, like people were asking me in California, you know, are we worried about like a nuclear cloud coming from Japan?\n",
      "I'm like, no, that's crazy. It's actually, it's not even dangerous in Fukushima. I actually flew there and ate locally grown vegetables on TV to prove it.\n",
      "And I donated a solar water treatment, yeah, it's a solar powered system for a water treatment plant.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "But I mean... It's fine, you know. It's like, you know, Hiroshima and Nagasaki were bombed, but now they're like full cities again.\n",
      "So it's really not something that, you know.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So it's not as scary as people think basically, but let's see. I mean, are there some other topics we should touch on? Oh, you know, like lawfare.\n",
      "I think, you know, we need to be concerned about... Obviously.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Well, it's clearly, I mean, it's clearly like we just don't have a president.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, this is simply not true.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "No, I mean, obviously what's happening sort of overnight is they're rewriting history and making Kamala sound like a moderate when in fact she is far left, like far, far left.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, no, no. I mean, Netanyahu came to give a talk to a joint Senate and House sitting, and I was there and Kamala stood him up. You know, what does that say?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I think you're right. I mean, it's important for the public that may be listening to this to say, to look at Kamala's track record, you know, before the last like month and say, is that a track record you agree with? And I think if you're an independent moderate, you definitely would not agree with it because it is, her behavior has been far left.\n",
      "And we're seeing just an overnight propaganda attempt to rewrite history and make it sound like Kamala's moderate when she in fact is not moderate.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I think we're in massive trouble, frankly, with the Kamala administration, and that's my honest opinion. And I think really it's essential that you won for the good of the country this election. And I mean, that's understating my opinion.\n",
      "Now, you may have seen this, but I got a letter from the EU Commission like saying to not have disinformation during this discussion that we're having. And there's a lot of attempts to do censorship and to force censorship even on Americans from other countries. And what do you think about that?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I think a lot of the public isn't aware of the fact that the United States pays a disproportionate share of the NATO expenses.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, well, I mean, the point of NATO is defending Europe and it's, you know, it's like, okay, well, why is the United States paying disproportionately more to defend Europe than Europe? That doesn't make sense, that's unfair. And that is an appropriate thing to address.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, well, I think it's obvious that you're a believer and an advocate of free speech because during your first time as president, you were attacked relentlessly every day, often very unfairly with false attacks. And you didn't try to shut down the media. You didn't try to inhibit their freedom of speech.\n",
      "And I think that says a lot.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "That's true.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "This is a really big point. You can actually have a conversation with you. Yeah, it's nice, isn't it?\n",
      "And you can't have a conversation with Biden or Kamala. It's like not, it's not possible. Yeah, it's true.\n",
      "So this is like talking to an NPC, so it's just impossible.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, that's for sure.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, well, you know, maybe like, I think it's part of what people in America wanna, you know, people in America wanna feel excited and inspired about the future. They wanna feel like the future is gonna be better than the past. And that America is gonna do things that are greater than we've done in the past, reach new heights that make you proud to be an American and excited about the future.\n",
      "They want the American dream back.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, it was just absurd. But I mean, I think there are like, you know, some grand projects that we could do. I mean, I think like, you know, we could build a base on the moon.\n",
      "We could send American astronauts to Mars. We could build high-speed connections that are more advanced than anything else in the world between our cities. So people have fast transport.\n",
      "You know, it's possible to solve traffic with tunnels. We've, you know, we already made great progress in Vegas doing that. And, you know, and just do things that are exciting and inspiring and make the future feel like it's better than the past.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "No, it's straightforward.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, and like, I think we could do some things that like, like China's got incredible high-speed rail between its cities. But I think it's actually possible with tunnels. If it was deregulation with an ability to actually, where it's like legal to actually do the tunnels, then you could have high-speed tunnels that are actually better than anything else in the world for high-speed transport between cities.\n",
      "And that would be something that, you know, Americans can say, wow, okay, we've got something that's cooler than anyone else in the world. That's the kind of thing that makes you proud to be an American.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, and I think also like there's, you know, I just, I'm kind of hopping on the excess regulation, but I think something that I think people can generally understand is that what happens with laws and regulations is that they just, there's more and more of them every year. And unless there's a process to clean them up, eventually everything becomes illegal. And that actually, it slows down the development of new technologies.\n",
      "I mean, if you take the sort of, like I think there's room for some reform at the FDA for improving the speed with which we approve drugs that could help save lives and improve people's lives.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, it just takes too long, and you end up in the same with the approval, but it just, you know, it takes years instead of something that I think could potentially take months that improves people's lives. I think, you know, but I just wanted to hop on this point that like there has to be an active process for reducing rules and regulations because otherwise they just keep building up every year and you get like hardening of the arteries, and eventually everything's illegal or takes forever. And then we just ossify as a society we just, we can't make any progress.\n",
      "And that's, it's a really big deal.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Well, I mean, and actually to give you some props here, it's like if a drug is approved in Europe, which has a crazy amount of regulations, it should obviously be approved in the US. I mean, they got more regulations than we do. So why would a drug be approved in Europe and not in the US?\n",
      "That's crazy.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Absolutely.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And I think as long as people are properly informed of the pros and cons and like, these are the risks, this is the risk.\n",
      "And like, you make your own decision. That makes sense.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Well, I think actually in terms of the number of people that will hear this conversation over the next few days, two weeks, it's going to be hundreds.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I mean, with all these things, I always try to get to the ground truth by just asking people. And my mom lives in New York. And I was like, mom, have any of your friends been attacked or assaulted?\n",
      "And she said, yeah, three of her friends in three separate incidents were assaulted just in recent months, just walking around the streets of New York. And I said, well, what happened to the people that assaulted them? Oh, nothing, they got away.\n",
      "Like, and they just know- They always get away. Nothing's gonna, and they don't even bother reporting it because they know that there's not, they're not gonna, you know, people are not gonna get prosecuted. They just let, you know, violent criminals out in New York.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, I mean, it's just obviously messed up if violent criminals are being getting off scot-free. And meanwhile, New York's spending massive resources prosecuting you. And it's like, what's this?\n",
      "You know, and I think the sort of sensible public looks at this and says, what the heck's going on here? This is obviously abuse of the legal system. You know, the legal system is supposed to be protecting the public from violent criminals.\n",
      "And it should be obviously allowing the public to make their own decision about who should be president as opposed to, you know, some, you know, legal case.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Absolutely.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's kind of you to say, thank you.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Thank you. And well, I mean, I just say, here's to an exciting, inspiring future that people can look forward to and be optimistic and excited about what happens next. And that's the kind of future that I think you will bring as president and that's why I endorse you.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I think that's a very real risk.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's a very real risk. And, you know, I'd just like to note to people listening, I've not been very political before. And if you look at my record, I've actually been, I'm not like, sometimes they try to paint me as like a far right guy, which is absurd because I like making electric vehicles and, you know, solar and batteries, helping them with the environment.\n",
      "And I actually, you know, I supported Obama. I stood in line for six hours to shake Obama's hand when he was running for president. And, you know, so it's not like I'm like some sort of dyed-in-the-wool long-term Republican.\n",
      "I'm actually, I call myself, you know, historically a moderate Democrat. But now I feel like we're really at a critical juncture for the country. And, you know, I think a lot of people thought, you know, that Biden administration would be a moderate administration, but it's not.\n",
      "And obviously, we're just gonna see an even further left administration with Kamala. That's my honest opinion. I mean, her dad is literally, I mean, she was brought up as an actual, her dad is a Marxist economist.\n",
      "That's, you can Google it. I mean, it's not a, we're not making this up, you know. That's how she was brought up.\n",
      "So, and we just, we wanna have a future that is prosperous. And I think we're just at this critical juncture. And I think this is a case of the, America is kind of at a fork in the road.\n",
      "And I think it will take the path, like you are the path to prosperity. And I think Kamala is the opposite. Then that's my, I mean, that's my honest opinion.\n",
      "I'm gonna get attacked like crazy. And, you know, I've also experienced quite a bit of lawfare myself. And, but I'm just trying to tell people my honest opinion.\n",
      "And I haven't been active in, really active in politics before. And I'm just trying to point out that my track record historically has been moderate, if not moderate, slightly left. And so this is to people out there who are in the moderate camp to say, I think you should support Donald Trump for president.\n",
      "And I think it's actually a very important junction in the road. And we're in deep trouble if it goes the other way.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, I mean, if I could summarize it perhaps, you know, I think these are issues that I think most people in America would agree with, which is that we want safe and clean cities. We want secure borders. We want sensible government spending.\n",
      "We want to restore both the perception and the reality of respect in the judicial system, just, you know, stop the lawfare. And I think that's like, and how are those even right-wing positions? I think those are just, that's just common sense.\n",
      "And that's, I mean, would you agree with that?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Well, absolutely. And it's obviously demoralizing if you're a police officer risking your life to arrest violent criminals who could kill you and do kill you sometimes. And then you arrest the violent criminal and then the DA doesn't prosecute and that's let the guy out.\n",
      "Well, then why should a police officer risk their life to arrest a violent felon?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Well, I thought it was very telling, like incredibly telling that when there was a case where sort of a gang of thugs beat up police officers. I think it was in Times Square in New York. And then nothing happened to those guys.\n",
      "They were let out, zero bail. And I think a bunch of them were given free tickets to California. Well, I mean, that is a gross indignity against the United States.\n",
      "And that's how, I mean, this is insane. Like, have we lost all pride? How can such a thing be allowed to occur?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, we just cannot have a situation where our police officers would be beaten up on camera by a gang of illegal immigrants and then nothing happens to the guys that beat up the cops. I mean, and they're let out. This is unacceptable.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, yeah. So it's just gotta be done. We just can't have, whether they're citizens or not citizens, we can't have, because they won't prosecute citizens either, not just illegals.\n",
      "So you can't have violent, repeat violent offenders that are not, that don't get incarcerated. That's right. Because they will obviously, by definition, continue to hurt people.\n",
      "And I think where part of this comes from is that this, and I do sort of consider myself liberal in some ways. I mean, it's just that you wanna have empathy for people. Obviously you wanna have empathy for people.\n",
      "I totally agree with that. You wanna have empathy, but you also have to have empathy for the victims of the criminals. And if you just have empathy for the criminals, it's actually shallow empathy.\n",
      "It's not real. You're not thinking. You have one layer deep empathy.\n",
      "You gotta say like, if you don't incarcerate this person, who are they going to hurt? They might kill someone. They might rape someone.\n",
      "If you don't incarcerate them, you have to have empathy for the victims. And there's a lack of empathy for the victims of the criminals and too much empathy for the criminals. It doesn't make sense.\n",
      "That's why you wanna have deep empathy for society as a whole, not shallow empathy for criminals.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The facts speak for themselves.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The facts speak for themselves. It's gotten to the point where people just don't even bother reporting crime in a lot of cities because they know nothing is gonna happen. That's what I hear anecdotally from people all the time.\n",
      "So, it's just, my values, I'm just saying to people out there, the things I think are important for the future is we've gotta have safe cities. We've gotta have secure borders. We've gotta have sensible spending.\n",
      "And we've gotta have deregulation. And so we can have a prosperous future. And then we wanna have some exciting sort of moonshot projects that people can get fired up about.\n",
      "And that's the future I'm looking for. And I'm pro-environment, but I'm not against, I don't think we should vilify the oil and gas industry because they're keeping civilization going right now. But I do think we wanna move at a reasonable speed towards a sustainable energy economy.\n",
      "Those are my values. And I think, so, I mean, that's why I'm supporting you for president.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "No, I think we're at a fork in the road of destiny of civilization. And I think we need to take the right path. And I think you're the right path.\n",
      "So I think that's what it comes down to.\n",

So it is the number one way that people actually are informed about any kind of news, meaning real time events is on the X platform, formally Twitter, there’s nothing even close for real time news. So we also want to expand upon that and we have done so with the long form content. So instead of just doing what you used to call tweets, you can do long form posts. You can post an entire essay. In fact, you can now put an entire book, post an entire book to the platform. You can do long form video content, so you can do up to four hour video segments. We really want news in whatever form it is, or information I should say, in whatever form it is to be available on our platform, whether it’s short, long, text, pictures, video, whatever the case may be.\n",

We want to have prominent names on the Left as well, to provide different views of points of view, as well as centrist. Just basically a wide range of viewpoints on the platform so users can hear different opinions. They can hear what’s your point of view, what’s Tucker’s point of view, and people can make their own decision about what they believe.\n",

I think that’s generally how people should take things, which is, there are a whole set of issues which are somewhat arbitrarily bucketed into Right or Left, but I think most citizens would think that they would agree with some things on the Left, but not everything, or they would agree with some things on the Right, but not everything.

I mentioned that it used to be that you can only do a short text and maybe a picture or something like that, a short video, but now you can do long form text, long form video. We’ve added audio video calling, so you can not just do text, DMs, you can do [inaudible 00:07:31] video calling. We’ve improved the algorithm, I think significantly and made the system faster and better and that’s reflected in the increased usage.\n",

So the objective fact of the matter, in my opinion, was that, old Twitter was fundamentally a tool of the far Left, and that was really, I think a lot of it was due to being located in San Francisco, Berkeley, and so it wanted to essentially project the SF, Berkeley political dogma worldwide.\n",

And even when they did suspend an account on the Left, it was because of arguments between two people on the Left. The political donations of old Twitter were 99% Democrat. Does that sound Left wing or Right wing to you?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yes. You know when they look at donations from a company, if a company donates… Literally 99% of all donations are to Democrats, does that strike you as a Left-leaning or a Right-leaning company?\n",

Last year the Tesla Model Y was the bestselling car of any kind in the world. So it was about 1.2 million units. It was the bestselling car despite being, I think around 50% more expensive than the next bestselling vehicle, of any kind, not just electric. So I think that’s a testament to the incredible work of the Tesla team. And we launched the Cybertruck. Obviously that’s being very well received. We have I think over a million orders for the Cybertruck. So it’s a really special product. I think the Cybertruck is one of those products that comes along really once in several years, maybe once a decade. The Cybertruck is a once a decade product. It is so special and I think it’s our best product.\n",

      "No, I got to reserve the cool stuff for when we actually unveil it, but it is going to be really cool. It’s going to have some rocket technology in it.

      "Right. You’re conflating two things. One is great replacement theory. The other is, which I don’t subscribe to that, I’m simply saying that there is an incentive here, if legal immigrants wish, I think have a very strong bias to, at least everything I’ve read, very strong bias to vote Democrat. The more that come into the country, the more they’re likely to vote in that direction. It is, in my view, a simple incentive to increase voters to Democrat voters.  (24:14) Yeah. Your question is how. There’s a few ways that this works. One is that, when the census is done, the census is based on all people in an area, whether they are citizens or not. If there are a concentration of people who came here legally, in a particular state, that state will actually then get an increased number of House seats. The House seat apportionment is proportionate to number of people, not the number of citizens. The illegals overwhelmingly go to places like California and New York, and if you just look at the math, if you look at the apportionment with and without illegals, I believe California would lose… I believe there will be a net loss of blue states of approximately 20 seats in the House.  (25:14) This also applies to the electoral college. You say this also applies to electing the president because the electoral votes are also done by apportionment the same way that House seats are done.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I think that statement is… What you said is true, but what I said is also true, which is that, as is the case, a disproportionate number of illegal immigrants go to blue states, they amplify the effect of a blue state vote. And the math, as I understand it, you can research this obviously very easily on there, it’s pretty straightforward to research this, but my understanding is that the Democrats would lose approximately 20 seats in the House if illegals were not counted in census and that’s also 20 less electoral votes for President. Illegals absolutely do affect who controls the House and who controls the presidency does not affect the Senate.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I didn’t call it a… I just said that there’s a simple matter of incentives. You don’t need a conspiracy when you have basic incentives. In my view, there’s a basic incentive. There’s fundamental… For the Democrat party to foster an usher in a large number of legals and you don’t need a conspiracy in that case because you have a very basic incentive. You could say I’m wrong about that incentive, but that’s my view. I’m not buying into some great replacement theory. I’m simply saying there appears to be a very clear incentive for Democrats to have to maximize the number of illegals because it helps them win elections.\n",

In order for a community note to surface, people who have historically disagreed must agree in order for a community note to surface.

Let’s say a surgeon in training is asked to do a series of operations out of the supervision of a senior surgeon and they get a bunch of those operations wrong. If that happens, and yet they are still approved to be a surgeon, the probability that someone will die I think at some point is high.\n",

But this is not in that category, this is really much thicker, deeper philosophical underpinings better financed to why I think it’s important to extend life beyond earth. It goes to the nature of importance. How do you decide that one thing is important versus another. And the layers of history -- I guess a good way to distinguish whether something is important or not. If you look at the history of the earth upon a geological grand scale -- what are the really important milestones in the history of life itself. Forget about the parochial concerns of humanity.

      "\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Well, the sports car will probably remain at that price point. But Tesla is developing a lower cost car, which is a sedan, it’s five passenger, four door sedan, quite large and it’s intended to be something that could be a family sedan or it can replace a small -- smallish SUV. It’s going to be in the 50 thousand dollar range. We’ll be producing 10 to 20 thousand of these a year. Then we’ve got Model which will be after that and that’ll be hopefully in the 30 to 35 thousand dollar range and we’ve got 100 to 200 thousand [unintelligible] volume. So, we try to do higher and higher volume and they become more and more affordable over time. The Tesla Roadster, the sports car, is really the beachhead of the technology. It’s the introductory product, allows us to refine the technology and make more affordable over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yes, actually I think the long term electric cars will be more economically competitive than the -- than the gasoline car. Also, the price of gasoline is going to rise over time given finite supplies and rapidly increasing demand, particularly from China and India, as we’ve seen. But in addition to the price of gas going up, the cost of electric transportation is going to go down, drive in part by companies like Tesla.\n",
      "\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Sure -- well, first of all it should be said that the efficiency of an electric car -- the electric car by Tesla is so great that if you were to take a gallon of oil and you would put power -- use that oil in an electric power station and take the efficiency of that power station -- subtract the transmission losses [unintelligible] of the electric power lines -- subtract the charging losses. And it said how many miles do you get out of that gallon of oil versus refine that gallon of oil into gasoline and run an equivalent sized car, using that gallon of gasoline -- what you’ll find is the electric car gives you at least twice as much mileage. So, that’s called the well to wheel efficiency. We do the fully [unintelligible] efficiency of a particular mode of transport. What it comes down to -- the reason -- the primary reason for that is that a gasoline engine is typically around 17 or 18 percent efficient. So, the energy in that gallon of gasoline -- the [unintelligible] [speaking over each other]\n",
      "\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Basically it’s roughly one part emission, four parts heat of the energy in that gallon of gasoline. But in comparison, the electric motor is a far more efficient device. The energy efficiency of electric motors is on the order of 90 percent. So that even after you take all those charging losses and all those other things into account, just have a fundamentally more efficient engine -- motor in the case of [unintelligible] But to answer your original question of what will charge -- we need the energy to charge the batteries for the cars and are we not simply extending the tail pipe to the power switch, so it’s a long tailpipe to the power station essentially. And the answer to that is -- well, first of all, electricity is the universal currency. You can generate electricity in many ways, including renewable ways such as solar power, wind, geothermal -- and in ways which are less damaging to the environment such as nuclear and -- and then even if you would generate energy with hydrocarbons such as coal or oil or natural gas, the energy efficiency of electric transportation is so much greater that you can still be twice as better off than you would otherwise be.\n",

      "Right. It’s true we’ve not built new nuclear plants in a couple decades. Although what most people don’t realize is that the existing nuclear plants have been massively upgraded. [Laughter] So, our percentage of nuclear power has actually not declined as much -- [speaking over each other]\n",
      "\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, we should build more nuclear power plants. I think that’s a better way to generate energy than certainly a coal power plant or a natural gas power plant. Burning hydrocarbons -- I think people now recognize is a pretty bad thing. You know over time there’s a certain limit to the CO2 capacity of the atmosphere and the oceans.\n",

      "Is that whole meme where all guys are thinking about the Roman Empire at least once a day?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, they usually came as a result of conquest. I mean, there’s some like the Hapsburg Empire where there was just a lot of clever marriages.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Tested, Grok approved. Yeah.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I’m generally a proponent of peace. I mean, ignorance is perhaps, in my view, the real enemy to be countered. That’s the real hard part, not fighting other humans, but all creatures fight. I mean, the jungle is… People think of nature as perhaps some sort of peaceful thing, but in fact it is not. There’s some quite funny Werner Herzog thing where he is in the jungle saying that it’s basically just murder and death in every direction. The plants and animals in the jungle are constantly trying to kill each other every single day, every minute. So it’s not like we’re unusual in that respect.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yes. We have much more vulnerability to control our limbic instinct for violence than say a chimpanzee. And in fact, if one looks at say, chimpanzee society, it is not friendly. I mean, the Bonobos are an exception, but chimpanzee society is filled with violence and it’s quite horrific, frankly. That’s our limbic system in action. You don’t want to be on the wrong side of a chimpanzee, it’ll eat your face off and tear your nuts off.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah. Chimpanzee society is a permanent version of human society. They’re not like peace loving basically at all. There’s extreme violence and then once in a while, somebody who’s watched too many Disney movies decides to raise a chimpanzee as a pet, and then that eats their face or they’re nuts off or chew their fingers off and that kind of thing. It’s happened several times.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It’s happened to people. It’s unfortunate. That’s, I guess, one way to ensure that the other chimp doesn’t contribute to the gene pool.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The nut rougher.\n",

      "Israel-Hamas war\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Well, I think that part of the world is definitely, if you look up… There is no easy answer in the dictionary. It’ll be the picture of the Middle East in Israel especially. So there is no easy answer. This is strictly my opinion is that the goal of Hamas was to provoke an overreaction from Israel. They obviously did not expect to have a military victory, but they really wanted to commit the worst atrocities that they could in order to provoke the most aggressive response possible from Israel, and then leverage that aggressive response to rally Muslims worldwide for the course of Gaza and Palestine, which they have succeeded in doing. So the counterintuitive thing here, I think that the thing that I think should be done, even though it’s very difficult, is that I would recommend that Israel engage in the most conspicuous acts of kindness possible, everything, that is the actual thing that we’re taught the goal of Hamas.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It’s not exactly turn the other cheek because I do think that it is appropriate for Israel to find the Hamas members and either kill them or incarcerate them. That’s something has to be done because they’re just going to keep coming otherwise. But in addition to that, they need to do whatever they can. There’s some talk of establishing, for example, a mobile hospital. I’d recommend doing that. Just making sure that there’s food, water, medical necessities and just be over the top about it and be very transparent. So [inaudible 00:07:22] can claim it’s a trick. Just put webcam on the thing or 24, 7.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, conspicuous acts of kindness that are unequivocal, meaning they can’t be somehow because Hamas will then their response will be, “Oh, it’s a trick.” Therefore, you have to counter how it’s not a trick.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yes. And I’m not sure who said it, it’s an [inaudible 00:07:54] saying, but an eye for an eye makes everyone blind. Now, that neck of the woods, they really believe in the whole eye for an eye thing. But you really have… If you’re not going to just outright commit genocide against an entire people, which obviously would not be acceptable to really, shouldn’t be acceptable to anyone, then you’re going to leave basically a lot of people alive who subsequently hate Israel. So really the question is like for every Hamas member that you kill, how many did you create? And if you create more than you killed, you’ve not succeeded. That’s the real situation there. And it’s safe to say that if you kill somebody’s child in Gaza, you’ve made at least a few homeless members who will die just to kill an Israeli. That’s the situation. But I mean, this is one of the most contentious subjects one could possibly discuss. But I think if the goal ultimately is some sort of long-term piece, one has to look at this from the standpoint of over time, are there more or fewer terrorists being created?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, war, safe to say, wars always existed and always will exist.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Always has existed and always will exist.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "There will always be war. There’s a question of just how much war and there’s sort of the scope and scale of war. But to imagine that there would not be any war in the future, I think would be a very unlikely outcome.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yes. It’s a giant war. The first book starts off with a gigantic galactic war where trillions die trillions.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, I guess if we are able to one day expand to fool the galaxy or whatever, there will be a galactic war at some point.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Military-Industrial Complex\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "One of the things that does concern me is that there are very few people alive today who actually viscerally understand the horrors of war, at least in the US. I mean, obviously there are people on the front lines in Ukraine and Russia who understand just how terrible war is, but how many people in the West understand it? My grandfather was in World War II. He was severely traumatized. He was there I think for almost six years in Eastern North Africa and Italy. All his friends were killed in front of him, and he would’ve died too, except they randomly gave some, I guess IQ test or something, and he scored very high. He was not an officer. He was I think a corporal or a sergeant or something like that because he didn’t finish high school because he had to drop out of high school because his dad died and he had to work to support his siblings. So because he didn’t graduate high school, he was not eligible for the offset corps.\n",
      "(00:11:57) So he kind of got put into the cannon fodder category basically. But then randomly they gave him this test. He was transferred to British intelligence in London. That’s where we met my grandmother. But he had PTSD next level, next level. I mean, just didn’t talk, just didn’t talk. And if you tried talking to him, he’d just tell you to shut up. And he won a bunch of medals, never bragged about it once, not even hinted nothing. I found out about it because his military records were online. That’s how I know. So he would say like, “No way in hell do you want to do that again.” But how many people… Obviously, he died, he 20 years ago or longer, actually 30 years ago. How many people are alive that remember World War II? Not many.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, I mean, there are enough nuclear bombs pointed at United States to make the radioactive revel balance many times.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I think we shouldn’t discount the possibility of nuclear war. It is a civilizational threat. Right now, I could be wrong, but I think the current probability of nuclear war is quite low. But there are a lot of nukes pointed at us, and we have a lot of nukes pointed at other people. They’re still there. Nobody’s put their guns away. The missiles are still in the silos.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "No, there are wars which are tragic and difficult on a local basis. And then there are wars which are civilization ending or has that potential. Obviously, global thermonuclear warfare has high potential to end civilization, perhaps permanently, but certainly to severely wound and perhaps set back human progress to the Stone Age or something. I don’t know. Pretty bad. Probably scientists and engineers want to be super popular after that as well. You got us into this mess. So generally, I think we obviously want to prioritize civilizational risks over things that are painful and tragic on a local level, but not civilizational.\n",
      "War in Ukraine\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Well, I think that what is likely to happen, which is really pretty much the way it is, is that something very close to the current lines will be how a ceasefire or truce happens. But you just have a situation right now where whoever goes on the offensive will suffer casualties at several times the rate of whoever’s on the defense because you’ve got defense in depth, you’ve got minefields, trenches, anti-tank defenses. Nobody has air superiority because the anti-aircraft missiles are really far better than the aircraft. They’re far more of them. And so neither side has air superiority. Tanks are basically death traps, just slow moving, and they’re not immune to anti-tank weapons. So you really just have long range artillery and infantry ranges. It’s World War I all over again with drones, thrown old drones, some drones there.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So whoever is… You don’t want to be trying to advance from either side because the probability of dying is incredibly high. So in order to overcome defense in depth, trenches and minefields, you really need a significant local superiority in numbers. Ideally combined alms where you do a fast attack with aircraft, a concentrated number of tanks, and a lot of people, that’s the only way you’re going to punch through a line and then you’re going to punch through and then not have reinforcements just kick you right out again. I mean, I really recommend people read World War I warfare in detail. That’s rough. I mean, the sheer number of people that died there was mind-boggling.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yes. The thing that… The reason I proposed some sort of truce or peace a year ago was because I’ve predicted pretty much exactly what would happen, which is a lot of people dying for basically almost no changes in land and the loss of the flower of Ukrainian and Russian youth. And we should have some sympathy for the Russian boys as well as the Ukrainian boys, because Russian boys, because boys didn’t ask to be on their frontline. They have to be. So there’s a lot of sons not coming back to their parents, and I think most of them don’t hate the other side. It’s sort of like as this saying comes from World War I, it’s like young boys who don’t know each other killing each other on behalf of old men that do know each other. The hell’s the point of that.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Look, I think I would just recommend do not send the flower of Ukrainian youth to die in trenches, whether he talks to Putin or not, just don’t do that. Whoever goes on the offensive will lose massive numbers of people and history will not look kindly upon them.\n",
      "China\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Well, it’s worth reading that book on the, difficult to pronounce, the Thucydides Trap, I believe it’s called. I love war history. I like inside out and backwards. There’s hardly a battle I haven’t read about. And trying to figure out what really was the cause of victory in any particular case as opposed to what one side or another claim the reason.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah. So that Athens and Sparta is a classic case. The thing about the Greek is they really wrote down a lot of stuff. They loved writing. There are lots of interesting things that happened in many parts of the world, but people didn’t write down, so we don’t know what happened or they didn’t really write in detail. They just would say, “We had a battle and we won.” And what? Can you add a bit more? The Greeks, they really wrote a lot. They were very articulate on… They just love writing. And we have a bunch of that writing as preserved. So we know what led up to the Peloponnesian War between the Spartanand Athenian Alliance, and we know that they saw it coming.\n",
      "(00:21:16) Spartans didn’t write… They also weren’t very verbose by their nature, but they did write, but they weren’t very verbose. They were [inaudible 00:21:23]. But the Athenians and the other Greeks wrote a line, and Spartan was really kind of like the leader of Greece. But Athens grew stronger and stronger with each passing year. And everyone’s like, “Well, that’s inevitable that there’s going to be a clash between Athens and Sparta. Well, how do we avoid that?” And actually they saw it coming and they still could not avoid it. So at some point, if one group, one civilization or country or whatever exceeds another sort of like the United States has been the biggest kid on the block since I think around 1890 from an economic standpoint.\n",
      "(00:22:14) So the United States has been the most powerful economic engine in the world longer than anyone’s been alive. And the foundation of war is economics. So now we have a situation in the case of China where the economy is likely to be two, perhaps three times larger than that of the US. So imagine you’re the biggest kid on the block for as long as anyone can remember, and suddenly a kid comes along who’s twice your size.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I’ve spent a lot of time in China and met with the leadership many times.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Well, the sheer number of really smart, hardworking people in China is incredible. There are really say how many smart, hardworking people are there in China? There’s far more of them there than there are here, I think, in my opinion. And they’ve got a lot of energy. So I mean, the architecture in China that’s in recent years is far more impressive than the US. I mean the train stations, the buildings, the high speed rail, everything, it’s really far more impressive than what we have in the US. I mean, I recommend somebody just go to Shanghai and Beijing, look at the buildings and go to take the train from Beijing to Xian, where you have the terracotta warriors. China’s got an incredible history, very long history, and I think arguably in terms of the use of language from a written standpoint, one of the oldest, perhaps the oldest written language, and then China, people did write things down.\n",
      "(00:24:50) So now China historically has always been, with rare exception, been internally focused. They have not been inquisitive. They’ve fought each other. There’ve been many, many civil wars. In the Three Kingdoms war, I believe they lost about 70% of their population. So they’ve had brutal internal wars, civil wars that make the US Civil War look small by comparison. So I think it’s important to appreciate that China is not monolithic. We sort of think of China as a sort of one entity of one mind. And this is definitely not the case. From what I’ve seen and I think most people who understand China would agree, people in China think about China 10 times more than they think about anything outside of China. So it’s like 90% of their consideration is internal.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The good news, the history of China suggests that China is not inquisitive, meaning they’re not going to go out and invade a whole bunch of countries. Now they do feel very strongly… So that’s good. I mean, because a lot of very powerful countries have been inquisitive. The US is also one of the rare cases that has not been inquisitive. After World War II, the US could have basically taken over the world in any country, we’ve got nukes, nobody else has got nukes. We don’t even have to lose soldiers. Which country do you want? And the United States could have taken over everything and it didn’t. And the United States actually helped rebuild countries. So it helped rebuild Europe, helped rebuild Japan. This is very unusual behavior, almost unprecedented.\n",
      "(00:27:10) The US did conspicuous acts of kindness like the Berlin Airlift. And I think it’s always like, well, America’s done bad things. Well, of course America’s done bad things, but one needs to look at the whole track record and just generally, one sort of test would be how do you treat your prisoners at war? Or let’s say, no offense to the Russians, but let’s say you’re in Germany, it’s 1945, you’ve got the Russian Army coming one side and you’ve got the French, British and American Army’s coming the other side, who would you like to be just surrendered to? No country is [inaudible 00:27:58] perfect, but I recommend being a POW with the Americans. That would be my choice very strongly.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Very much so. And in fact, Wernher von Braun, a smart guy, was like, “We’ve got to be captured by the Americans.” And in fact, the SS was under orders to execute von Braun and all of the German rocket conditioners, and they narrowly escaped. They said they were going out for a walk in the woods. They left in the middle of winter with no coats and then ran, but no food, no coats, no water, and just ran like hell and ran West and Vice Sherlock, I think his brother found a bicycle or something and then just cycled West as fast as he couldn’t have found a US patrol. So anyway, that’s one way you can tell morality is where do you want to be a PW? It’s not fun anywhere, but some places are much worse than others. Anyway, so America has been, while far from perfect, generally a benevolent force, and we should always be self-critical and we try to be better, but anyone with half a brain knows that.\n",
      "(00:29:31) So I think there are… In this way, China and the United States are similar. Neither country has been acquisitive in a significant way. So that’s a shared principle, I guess. Now, China does feel very strongly about Taiwan. They’ve been very clear about that for a long time. From this standpoint, it would be like one of the states is not there like Hawaii or something like that but more significant than Hawaii. And Hawaii is pretty significant for us. So they view it as really there’s a fundamental part of China, the island of Formosa, not Taiwan, that is not part of China, but should be. And the only reason it hasn’t been is because the US Pacific fleet.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yes, China has been very clear that they’ll incorporate Taiwan peacefully or militarily, but that they will incorporate it from their standpoint is 100% likely.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Absolutely. So after World War I, they made a big mistake. They basically tried to lump all of blame on Germany and saddle Germany with impossible reparations. And really there was quite a bit of blame to go around for World War I, but they try to put it all in Germany and that laid the seeds for World War II. So a lot of people, were not just Hitler, a lot of people felt wronged and they wanted vengeance and they got it.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, you kill somebody’s father, mother or son, daughter, they’re not going to forget it. They’ll want vengeance. So after World War II, they’re like, “Well, the Treaty of Versi was a huge mistake in World War I. And so this time, instead of crushing the losers, we’re actually going to help them with the module plan, and we’re going to help rebuild Germany. We’re going to help rebuild Austria and Italy and whatnot.” So that was the right move.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Something must stop the cycle of reciprocal violence. Something must stop it, or it’ll never stop. Just eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, limb for a limb, life for a life forever and ever.\n",
      "xAI Grok\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, I guess I’m to blame for that one.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, absolutely. Our AI, Grok, is modeled after The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, which is one of my favorite books, which it’s a book on philosophy. It’s-\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "My favorite books, it’s a book on philosophy, disguises book on humor. And I would say that forms the basis of my philosophy, which is that we don’t know the meaning of life, but the more we can expand the scope and scale of consciousness, digital and biological, the more we’re able to understand what questions to ask about the answer that is the universe. So I have a philosophy of curiosity.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Well, we are actually working hard to have engineering math, physics answers that you can count on. So for the other AIs out there, these so-called large language models, I’ve not found the engineering to be reliable. It unfortunately hallucinates most when you at least want it to hallucinate. So when you’re asking important, difficult questions, that’s when it tends to be confidently wrong. So we’re really trying hard to say, okay, how do we be as grounded as possible? So you can count on the results, trace things back to physics first principles, mathematical logic. So underlying the humor is an aspiration to adhere to the truth of the universe as closely as possible.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It is tricky. So that’s why there’s always going to be some amount of error. But do we want to aspire to be as truthful as possible about the answers with acknowledged error. So that there was always, you don’t want to be confidently wrong, so you’re not going to be right every time, but you want to minimize how often you’re confidently wrong. And then like I said, once you can count on the logic as being not violating physics, then you can start to bull on that to create inventions, like invent new technologies. But if you cannot count on the foundational physics being correct, obviously the inventions are simply wishful thinking, imagination land. Magic basically.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yes, that’s how simple three word mission.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "If an AI cannot figure out new physics, it’s clearly not equal to humans, nor has surpassed humans because humans have figured out new physics. Physics is just deepening what’s inside into how reality works. And then there’s engineering which is inventing things that have never existed. Now the range of possibilities for engineering is far greater than for physics because once you figure out the rules of the universe, that’s it. You’ve discovered things that already existed. But from that you can then build technologies that are really almost limitless in the variety. And it’s like once you understand the rules of the game properly, and with current physics, we do at least at a local level, understand how physics works very well. Our ability to predict things is incredibly good. Degree to which quantum mechanics can predict outcomes is incredible. That was my hardest class in college by the way. My senior quantum mechanics class was harder than all of my other classes put together.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah. You have to test any conclusions against the ground truth of reality. Reality is the ultimate judge. Like physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation. I’ve seen plenty of people break the laws made by man, but none break the laws made by physics.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And it’s also not the case currently that even that its internal logic is not consistent. So especially with the approach of just predicting a token predict token, predict token, it’s like a vector sum. You’re summing up a bunch of vectors, but you can get drift. A little bit of error adds up and by the time you are many tokens down the path, it doesn’t make any sense.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It has to be self-aware about the drift, and then look at the thing as a gestalt as a whole and say it doesn’t have coherence as a whole. When authors write books, they will write the book and then they’ll go and revise it, take into account all the end and the beginning and the middle and rewrite it to achieve coherence so that it doesn’t end up at a nonsensical place.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Create a draft and then you iterate on that draft until it has coherence, until it all adds up basically.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "No, I in team America. Wait, there is.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah. I think we need to understand intelligence, understand consciousness. I mean there are some fundamental questions of what is thought, what is emotion? Is it really just one atom bumping into another atom? It feels like something more than that. So I think we’re probably missing some really big things.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Well, some people would quote like a soul religion, be a soul. You feel like you’re you, I mean you don’t feel like you’re just a collection of atoms, but on what dimension does thought exist? What dimension does do emotions exist? Because we feel them very strongly. I suspect there’s more to it than atoms bumping into atoms.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah. What is consciousness? When you put the atoms in a particular shape, why are they able to form thoughts and take actions and feelings?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah. Why does the solution exist? On what plane does the solution exist? And sometimes I wonder is either perhaps everything’s conscious or nothing’s conscious. One of the two.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It does seem more fun, yes. But we’re composed of atoms and those atoms are composed of quarks and leptons and those quarks and leptons have been around since the beginning of the universe.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "What seems to be the beginning of the universe.\n",
      "Aliens\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Where are the aliens?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "That’s one of the foam paradox question. A lot of people have asked me if I’ve seen any evidence of aliens and I haven’t, which is kind of concerning. I think I’d probably prefer to at least have seen some archeological evidence of aliens. To the best of my knowledge, I’m not aware of any evidence surveillance. If they’re out there, they’re very subtle. We might just be the only consciousness, at least in the galaxy. And if you look at say the history of Earth, to believe the archeological record Earth is about four and a half billion years old. Civilization as measured from the first writing is only about 5,000 years old. We have to give some credit there to the ancient Sumerians who aren’t around anymore. I think it was an archaic pre-form was the first actual symbolic representation, but only about 5,000 years ago. I think that’s a good date for when we say civilization started. That’s 1000000th of Earth’s existence.\n",
      "(00:46:35) So civilization has been around. It’s really a flash in the pan so far. And why did it take so long? Four and a half billion years, for the vast majority of the time, there was no life. And then there was archaic bacteria for a very long time. And then you had mitochondria get captured, multicellular life, differentiation into plants and animals, life moving from the oceans to land, mammals, higher brain functions. And the sun is expanding slowly but it’ll heat the earth up at some point in the future, boil the oceans and earth will become like Venus, where life as we know it is impossible. So if we do not become multiplanetary and ultimately solar system, annihilation of all life on earth is a certainty. A certainty.

      "There may not be a master plan in the sense. So maybe an interesting answer to the question of determinism versus free will is that if we are in a simulation, the reason that these higher beings would hold a simulation is to see what happens. So they don’t know what happens otherwise they wouldn’t hold the simulation. So when humans create a simulation, so it’s SpaceX and Tesla, we create simulations all the time. Especially for the rocket, you have to run a lot of simulations to understand what’s going to happen because you can’t really test the rocket until it goes to space and you want it to work. So you have to simulate subsonic, transonic, supersonic, hypersonic, ascend, and then coming back, super high heating and orbital dynamics. All this has got to be simulated because you don’t get very many kicks at the can. But we run the simulations to see what happens, not if we knew what happens, we wouldn’t run the simulation. So whoever created this existence, they’re running it because they don’t know what’s going to happen, not because they do.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Well, I think it’s helpful, the tools of physics are very powerful and can be applied I think to really any arena in life. It’s really just critical thinking. For something important you need to reason with from first principles and think about things in the limit one direction or the other. So in the limit, even at the Kardashev scale, meaning even if you harness the entire power of the sun, you’ll still care about useful compute per watt. That’s where I think, probably where things are headed from the standpoint of AI is that we have a silicon shortage now that will transition to a voltage transformer shortage in about a year. Ironically, transformers for transformers. You need transformers to run transformers.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I think, yes, fate loves irony, ironic humor, an ironically funny outcome seems to be often what fate wants.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah. But yeah, so we have silicon shortage today, a voltage step down transformer shortage probably in about a year, and then just electricity shortages in general in about two years. I gave a speech for the world gathering of utility companies, electricity companies, and I said, look, you really need to prepare for traveling of electricity demand because all transport is going to go electric with the ironic exception of rockets, and heating will also go electric. So energy usage right now is roughly one third, very rough terms, one third electricity, one third transport, one third heating. And so in order for everything to go sustainable, to go electric, you need to triple electricity output. So I encourage the utilities to build more power of plants and also to probably have, well, not probably, they should definitely buy more batteries because the grid currently is sized for realtime load, which is kind of crazy because that means you’ve got to size for whatever the peak electricity demand is, the worst second or the worst day of the year, or you can have a brown out or blackout.\n",
      "(01:13:37) We had that crazy blackout for several days in Austin because there’s almost no buffering of energy in the grid. If you’ve got a hydropower plant you can buffer energy, but otherwise it’s all real time. So with batteries, you can produce energy at night and use it during the day so you can buffer. So I expect that there will be very heavy usage of batteries in the future because the peak to trough ratio for power plants is anywhere from two to five, so its lowest point to highest point.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yes. Yes. I mean, electrification of transport and electric heating will be much bigger than AI, at least-\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "In the short term. But even for AI, you really have a growing demand for electricity, for electric vehicles, and a growing demand for electricity to run the computers for AI. And so this is obviously, can lead to electricity shortage.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It will get solved. It’s the question of how long it takes to solve it. So at various points, there’s some kind of limiting factor to progress and with regard to AI, I’m saying right now the limiting factor is silicon chips and that will, we’re going to then have more chips than we can actually plug in and turn on probably in about a year. The initial constraint being literally voltage step down transformers because you’ve got power coming in at 300,000 volts and it’s got to step all the way down eventually to around 0.7 volts. So it’s a very big amount of, the voltage step down is gigantic and the industry is not used to rapid growth.\n",
      "AI regulation\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Well, I mean I’ve been pushing for some kind of regulatory oversight for a long time. I’ve been somewhat of a Cassandra on the subject for over a decade. I think we want to be very careful in how we develop AI. It’s a great power and with great power comes great responsibility. I think it would be wise for us to have at least an objective third party who can be like a referee that can go in and understand what the various leading players are doing with AI, and even if there’s no enforcement ability, they can at least voice concerns publicly. Jeff Hinton, for example, left Google and he voiced strong concerns, but now he’s not at Google anymore, so who’s going to voice the concerns? So I think there’s, Tesla gets a lot of regulatory oversight on the automotive front. We’re subject to, I think over a hundred regulatory agencies domestically and internationally. It’s a lot. You could fill this room with the all regulations that Tesla has to adhere to for automotive. Same is true for rockets and for, currently, the limiting factor for SpaceX for Starship launch is regulatory approval.\n",
      "(01:18:13) The FAA has actually given their approval, but we’re waiting for fish and wildlife to finish their analysis and give their approval. That’s why I posted I want to buy a fish license on, which also refers to the Monte Python sketch. Why do you need a license for your fish? I don’t know. But according to the rules, I’m told you need some sort of fish license or something. We effectively need a fish license to launch a rocket. And I’m like, wait a second. How did the fish come into this picture? I mean, some of the things I feel like are so absurd that I want to do a comedy sketch and flash at the bottom. This is all real. This is actually what happened.\n",
      "(01:19:02) One of the things that was a bit of a challenge at one point is that they were worried about a rocket hitting a shark. And the ocean’s very big, and how often do you see sharks? Not that often. As a percentage of ocean surface area, sharks basically are zero. And so then we said, well, how will we calculate the probability of killing a shark? And they’re like, well, we can’t give you that information because they’re worried about shark fin hunters going and hunting sharks and I said, well, how are we supposed to, we’re on the horns of a dilemma then.\n",
      "(01:19:40) They said, well, there’s another part of fish and wildlife that can do this analysis. I’m like, well, why don’t you give them the data? We don’t trust them. Excuse me? They’re literally in your department. Again, this is actually what happened. And then can you do an NDA or something? Eventually they managed to solve the internal quandary, and indeed the probability of us hitting a shark is essentially zero. Then there’s another organization that I didn’t realize existed until a few months ago that cares about whether we would potentially hit a whale in international waters. Now, again, you look the surface, look at the Pacific and say what percentage of the Pacific consists of whale? I could give you a big picture and point out all the whales in this picture. I’m like, I don’t see any whales. It’s basically 0%, and if our rocket does hit a whale, which is extremely unlikely beyond all belief, fate had it, that’s a whale has some seriously bad luck, least lucky whale ever.\n",

Well, I mean one of the things that’s pretty wild is for launching out of Vanderberg in California, we had to, they were worried about seal procreation, whether the seals would be dismayed by the sonic booms. Now, there’ve been a lot of rockets launched out of Vandenberg and the seal population has steadily increased. So if anything, rocket booms are an aphrodisiac, based on the evidence, if you were to correlate rocket launches with seal population. Nonetheless, we were forced to kidnap a seal, strap it to a board, put headphones on the seal and play sonic boom sounds to it to see if it would be distressed. This is an actual thing that happened. This is actually real. I have pictures.\n",

They’re definitely going to eat me. How old the seal, when seal goes back to other seal friends, how’s he going to explain that?\n",

And at one point he called me a speciesist for being pro-human, and I’m like, well, what team are you on, Larry? He’s still on Team Robot to be clear. And I’m like, okay. So at the time Google had acquired DeepMind, they had probably two thirds of all AI researchers in the world. They had basically infinite money and compute, and the guy in charge, Larry Page, did not care about safety and even yelled at me and caught me a speciesist for being pro-human.\n",

It was mostly Demis on one side and me on the other, both trying to recruit Ilya, and Ilya went back and forth, he was going to stay at Google, he was going to leave, then he was going to stay, then he’ll leave. And finally he did agree to join OpenAI. That was one of the toughest recruiting battles we’ve ever had. But that was really the linchpin for OpenAI being successful. And I was also instrumental in recruiting a number of other people, and I provided all of the funding in the beginning, over $40 million. And the name, the open in open AI is supposed to mean open source, and it was created as a nonprofit open source, and now it is a closed source for maximum profit, which I think is not good karma.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Like I said, I’d like to be friends again with Larry. I haven’t seen him in ages and we were friends for a very long time.

      "(01:33:50) It’d be like tweet for two hours? Come on. Tweet made sense when it was 140 characters of text. Because it’s like a bunch of little birds tweeting. But when you’ve got long form content, it’s no longer a tweet. So a movie is not a tweet. Apple, for example, posted the entire episode of The Silo, the entire thing, on a platform. By the way, it was their number one social media thing ever in engagement of anything, on any platform ever. So it was a great idea. And by the way, I just learned about it afterwards. I was like, Hey, wow, they posted an entire hour long episode of, so no, that’s not a tweet. This is a video.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, I mean right now it’s a hodgepodge for that reason. Let’s say in the case of Apple posting an entire episode of this series, pretty good series, by the way, The Silo, I watched it. So there’s going to be a lot of discussion around it. So you’ve got a lot of context, people commenting, they like it, they don’t like it or they like this, and you can then populate the vector space based on the context of all the comments around it. So even though it’s a video, there’s a lot of information around it that allows you to populate back to space of that hour long video. And then you can obviously get more sophisticated by having the AI actually watch the movie and tell you if you’re going to like the movie.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Analyze this movie and just like your movie critic or TV series and then recommend based on after AI watches the movie, just like a friend can tell you, if a friend knows you well, a friend can recommend a movie with high probability that you’ll like it.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, actually, frankly, AI will be better than, will know you better than your friends know you, most of your friends anyway.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Absolutely. You want ads that are, advertising that is, if it’s for a product or service that you actually need when you need it, it’s content. And then even if it’s not something that you need when you need it, if it’s at least aesthetically pleasing and entertaining, it could be like a Coca-Cola ad. They actually run a lot of great ads on the X system and McDonald’s does too. And you can do something that’s like, well, this is just a cool thing. And so basically the question is, do you regret seeing it or not? And if you don’t regret seeing it’s a win.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, attention is a big factor.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So that’s why it is actually better to do things that are long form on the system because it basically is tallying up how many user seconds, users were interested in this thing for how many seconds? So if it’s a really short thing, well they will be less. If it’s a link leading out of the system, which we’re not opposed to at all, it just is going to have fewer user seconds then that article was posted on the X platform.\n",

Whether someone is right, left, independent, whatever the case may be, that the platform is as fair and as much of a level playing field as possible.

So if sometimes people are like, well, has it moved to the right? Well, it’s moved to the center. So from the perspective of the far left, yes it has moved to the right because everything’s to the right from the far left, but no one on the far left that I’m aware of has been suspended or banned or deamplified. But we’re trying to be inclusive for the whole country and for farther countries too. So there’s a diversity of viewpoints and free speech only matters if people you don’t like are allowed to say things you don’t like.

      "Yeah, so the magic of community notes is…\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The magic of Community Notes is it requires people who have historically disagreed in how they’ve rated notes. In order to write a note or rate, you have to rate many notes. And so, we actually do use AI here. So, we populate a vector space around how somebody has rated notes in the past. So, it’s not as simple as left or right, because there are many more… Life is much more complex than left or right.\n",
      "(01:45:33) So, there’s a bunch of correlations in how you rate a Community Notes post, Community Notes. So then, in order for a community note to actually be shown, people who historically have disagreed on a subject must agree in order for a note to be shown. That’s the essential magic of it.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I think this is taking things from the press. Yeah, that is not correct. The reason I agreed to the fine for the SEC is not because the SEC was correct, that was extremely bad behavior by the SEC, corruption, frankly. But if I did not agree to pay the fine, Tesla would’ve gone bankrupt immediately.\n",
      "(01:49:08) So, I was told by our CFO that the banks would immediately suspend our lines of credit. And if they suspend our lines of credit, at that time, we would’ve gone bankrupt instantly. So, there would never have been an opportunity for a trial because Tesla would be dead. So really, this is like someone holding a gun to your kid’s head and saying, “Pay $20 million and admit…” This is like a hostage negotiation.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It should be. But not once did the SEC go after any of the hedge funds who were nonstop shorting and distorting Tesla. Not once. The hedge funds would lie flat out on TV for their own gain at the expense of retail investors. Not once. Literally a thousand times, not once did the SEC pursue them.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The incentive structure is messed up because the lawyers at the SEC are not paid well, it’s a fairly low paying job, but what they’re looking for is a trophy from the SEC. They’re looking for something they put on, basically, their LinkedIn. From that, they can get a job at a high paying law firm. That’s exactly what the lawyer here did.\n",
      "(01:50:37) And the reason they don’t attack the hedge funds is because those hedge funds employ those law firms. And they know if they attack the hedge funds, they’re affecting their future career prospects. So, they sell small investors down the river for their own career. That’s what actually happens. Regulatory capture.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah. Not good. So, the only reason I accepted that thing… Technically, it was a… It’s neither admit nor deny guilt. But the only reason I agreed to that at all was because I was told Tesla would be bankrupt otherwise. If there was an SEC investigation like this, banks would suspend funding, we’re bankrupted immediately, at the time. Now, we’re in a much stronger position.\n",

It is also, I guess, taken this from the conventional media.\n",

      "They’re both going to understand the world, but I think Tesla’s approach is fundamentally more compute efficient. It had to be, there was no choice. Our brain is very compute efficient, very energy efficient. Think of what is our brain able to do. There’s only about 10 watts of higher brain function, not counting stuff that’s just used to control our body. The thinking part of our brain is less than 10 watts. And those 10 watts can still produce a much better novel than a 10 megawatt GPU cluster. So, there’s a six order of magnitude difference there.\n",
      "(02:07:56) I mean, the AI has thus far gotten to where it is via brute force, just throwing massive amounts of compute and massive amounts of power at it. So, this is not where it will end up. In general, with any given technology, you first try to make it work, and then you make it efficient. So I think we’ll find, over time, that these models get smaller, are able to produce sensible output with far less compute, far less power. Tesla is arguably ahead of the game on that front because we’ve just been forced to try to understand the world with 100 watts of compute.\n",
      "(02:08:51) And there are a bunch of fundamental functions that we forgot to include. So, we had to run a bunch of things in emulation. We fixed a bunch of those with hardware four, and then hardware five will be even better. But it does appear, at this point, that the car will be able to drive better than a human, even with hardware three and 100 watts of power.

If you want satellites sent to orbit reliably, SpaceX will do 80% of all mass to orbit this year. China will do 12%. The rest of the world will do eight. That includes Boeing, Lockheed, and everyone else. So the track record of the rocket is the best by far of anything. You could hate my guts. You could not trust me. It is irrelevant. The rocket track record speaks for itself. With respect to Tesla, we make the best cars. Whether you hate me, like me or indifferent, do you want the best car or do you not want the best car?

I did subsequently clarify it in replies, but those clarifications were ignored by the media. And essentially I handed a loaded gun to those who hate me. And arguably to those who are antisemitic. For that, I’m quite sorry. That was not my intention. So I did post on my primary timeline to be absolutely clear that I’m not an antisemitic and that I, in fact, if anything am [inaudible 00:10:12], and the trip to Israel was planned before any of that happened.

      "Of all the posts I’ve done on the platform, I think there might be 30,000 or something like that, right? Once in a while I’ll say something foolish and I have. And I would certainly put that comment that you’ve said the actual truth among perhaps one of the most foolish, if not the most foolish thing I’ve ever done on the platform. And I did do my best to clarify afterwards that I certainly do don’t mean anything antisemitic in that. The nature of the criticism was simply that the Jewish people have been persecuted for thousands of years. There is a natural affinity therefore for persecuted groups. This has led to the funding of organizations that essentially promote any persecuted group or any group with the perception of persecution. This includes radical Islamic groups. Everyone here has seen the massive demonstrations for Hamas in every major city in the west. That should be jarring. Well, a number of those organizations received funding from prominent people in the Jewish community. They didn’t expect that to happen. But if you generically without condition sort of fund… If you fund persecuted groups in general, some of those persecuted groups unfortunately want your annihilation. And what I meant by that, when I subsequently clarified is that it’s unwise to fund organizations that support groups that want your annihilation. Is this coming across clearly it at this point?\n",

And I try to do my best to clarify six ways to Sunday. But at least I think over time it’ll be obvious that in fact, far from being antisemitic, I’m in fact [inaudible 00:20:14] and all the evidence in my track record would support that.\n",

So I’m aware that things can get promoted that are negative beyond the sort of circle of somebody simply screaming crazy things in Times Square, which happens all the time. Actually, it’s pretty rare for something frankly that is hateful to be promoted. It’s not that it never happens, but it’s fairly rare. I mean, I would encourage people to look for those that use the system. When you look at the feed that you receive, how often is it hateful? And over time, has it gotten more or less hateful? I would say that if you look at the X platform today versus a year ago, I think it is actually much better. I mean, what is your personal experience?\n",

I have more ideas than I could possibly execute, so I have no shortage of ideas. Innovation is not the problem. Execution is the problem. I’ve got a million ideas. I’ve got an entire design for an electric supersonic vertical takeoff jet, but if I just can’t do that as well. I’ve had that for 10 years. There’s a million things.\n",

      "We need a psychiatrist couch here or something. I think to some degree, I was born this way and then I was amplified by a difficult childhood, frankly. But I can remember even in happy moments when I was a kid, that it just feels like there’s just a rage of forces in my mind constantly. Now, this productively manifests itself in technology and building things for the most part. And I think on balance, the output has been very productive. I think the results, as we discussed earlier with SpaceX, Tesla, PayPal which is still going today, the first internet company that I started. In fact, the first internet company I started, Zipto, was funded by a New York Times Company, Hearst, Knight Ritter.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And we wrote some of the software for the New York Times website and we helped bring online several hundred newspapers that previously were only in print. Now, this is in the ’90s, which at this point is like, I’m like a grandpa basically. The ’90s and internet feels like a pre-Cambrian era when there were only sponges. Anyway, I feel like a lot of productive things have been done. And you can also look at Tesla as being many companies in one. Like if the Tesla supercharging network were its own company, it would be a Fortune 500 company by itself, just the supercharging system. We also make the cells, we build the power electronics and the powertrain from scratch. We have the most innovative structural design, the largest castings ever used. We have the best manufacturing technology at Tesla, better manufacturing technology than companies that have been doing it for 100 years. So these demons of the mind are, for the most part, harnessed to productive ends.\n",

      "Prove to who.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "No. If I were to describe my philosophy, it is a philosophy of curiosity. I did have this existential crisis when I was around 12, about what’s the meaning of life? Isn’t it all pointless? Why not just commit suicide? Why exist? I read the religious texts. I read the philosophy books. That, especially the German philosophy books, made me quite depressed frankly. Want you not read Schopenhauer Nietzsche as a teenager. But then I read Douglas Adams’ Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, which is a book on philosophy in the form of humor. And the point that Adamus was making there was that we don’t actually know what questions to ask. That’s why I said that, the answer is 42. Basically earth’s a giant computer and it came up with the answer 42. But then to actually figure out what the question is, that’s the actual hard part. And I think this is generally true also in physics. At the point at which you can properly frame the question, the answer is actually the easy part.\n",
      "\n",
      "(30:37)\n",
      "So my motivation then was that, well, my life is finite, really a flash in the pan on a galactic timescale. But if we can expand the scope and scale of consciousness, then we are better able to figure out what questions to ask about the answer that is the universe. And maybe we can find out the meaning of life or even what the right question to ask is. Where do we come from? Where are we going? Where are the aliens? Are there aliens? These questions, is there new physics to discover? Because there seems to be some real questions around dark matter and dark energy. So the purpose of SpaceX is to extend life beyond earth on a sustained basis, so that we can at least pass one of the Fermi Great Filters, which is that of being a single-planet civilization.\n",
      "\n",
      "(31:53)\n",
      "If we are single-planet civilization, then we are simply waiting around for some extinction event, whether that is manmade or natural. But if you’re a single-planet civilization, eventually something will happen to that planet and you will die. If you’re a multi-planet civilization, you’ll live much longer. Also, multi-planet civilization, that’s the natural stepping stone to being a multi-stellar civilization and being out there among the stars. So now, this I think has two… This is not simply a defensive motivation, but it is also one where that gives meaning, man’s search for meaning.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "All right. Let me finish this philosophy point, even though it may seem rather esoteric, it may resonate with a few people. We must get past this Fermi Great Filter of being a single-planet civilization. And if we do that, we are more likely to understand the nature of the universe and what questions to ask. If you believe in the philosophy of curiosity, then I think you should support this ambition. Being a multi-planet species is more than simply life insurance for life collectively. That’s a defensive reason. But I think also that life has to be more than simply solving one sad problem after another. There have to be reasons for you wake up in the morning and you’re happy to be alive. There have to be reasons that you have to say, why are you excited about the future? What gives you hope? And if you aren’t sure, ask your kids. And I think the idea of us being a space-faring civilization and being out there among the stars is incredibly inspiring and exciting and something to look forward to. And there need to be such things in the world.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Well, sometimes they’re right.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yes.\n",

      "Yes. Yes.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I think what you trying to say is that, do I at this point think because I’ve been right so many times for others who said I’m wrong, that now I best believe I’m right when, in fact, I’m wrong?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "No, I’m right. So yeah, no, look, here’s the thing. Physics is unforgiving. Physics is unforgiving. I have these various little sayings that I’ve come up with, that physics is the law and everything else is a recommendation.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "In the sense that you can break any law made by humans, but try breaking a law made by physics. That’s much more difficult. So if you are wrong and persist in being wrong, the rockets will blow up and the cars will fail. So we’re not trying to figure out what flavor of ice cream is the best flavor of ice cream. There’s 1,000 things that can happen on a rocket flight, and only one of them gets the rocket to orbit. And so being wrong results in failure when dealing with physical objects.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I hope he does.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah. Yeah. I actually agree with a lot of Jeff’s motivations. Let me put it this way, if there was a button I could press that would delete Blue Origin, I wouldn’t press it. So I think it’s good that he’s spending money on making rockets too. I’d suggest perhaps he spend more time on it, but it’s up to him. I should make a point here. So nothing any of my companies have done has been to stifle competition. In fact, we’ve done the opposite. So at Tesla, we have open sourced our patents. Anyone can use our patents for free. How many companies do you know who’ve done that? Can you name one? I can’t. At SpaceX, we don’t use patents. Once in a while we’ll file a patent just so some patent troll doesn’t cause trouble. But we’ve done nothing anti-competitive. We’ve done nothing to stop our competitors.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I just want to clarify for the audience, because some companies have done anti-competitive things. I think the strange thing, the unusual thing about SpaceX and Tesla is that we’ve done things that have helped our competition. So at Tesla, we have made our supercharger system open access. We’ve made our charger technology available for free to the other manufacturers. No walled garden. We could have put a wall up, but instead we invited them in.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I think it’s important for the audience to understand that the reason I have these powers is not because of some anti-competitive actions. It’s simply because we’ve executed very well.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "There are other satellites out there, you know?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Right.\n",

      "Okay.\n",

      "Exactly.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Like I said, we’re not the only company who has communication satellites. Our satellites are just much better than theirs. So it’s not like we have a monopoly, we just have the best product?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I think at the end of the day, if we make bad products that people don’t want to use, then the users will vote with their resources and use something else.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Certainly, my company’s overseen by regulators. Since SpaceX, Starlink, Tesla are overseen by cumulatively over 100 regulators, and actually more than that, a few hundred regulators because you’ve got, we’re in fifty-five countries. If you sum up all the times that I had an argument with regulators, of hundreds of regulators over decades, it can sound really terrible, except but they forgot to mention that there were 10 million regulations we complied with and only five that I disagreed with. But they list all the five and it sounds like, wow, this guy’s a real maverick. I’m like, yeah, but what about the 10 million we complied with?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Well, it’s not SpaceX.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The best that the X platform can do is adhere to the laws of any given country. Do you think there’s something more we could do than that?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Well, first of all, Starlink and SpaceX do no business in China whatsoever. Tesla has one of four factories, four vehicle factories in China. And China is, I don’t know, a quarter of our market or something like that. So it’s a quarter of the market of one company. The same is true, by the way, of all the other car companies. They also have something on that order of a quarter of their sales in China. So if that’s a problem for Tesla, it’s a problem for every car company. I think one has to be careful about not conflating the various companies. Because I can only do things that are within the bounds of the law, I cannot do beyond that. My aspiration is to do as much good as possible and to be as productive as possible within the bounds of what is legal. More than that, I cannot do.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yes. There’s a video of Jensen and me unpacking the first AI computer at OpenAI.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Co-founded it, yeah. Well, the whole arc of OpenAI, frankly is a little troubling, because the reason for starting OpenAI was to create a counterweight to Google and DeepMind, which at the time had two-thirds of all AI talent and basically infinite money and compute. And there was no counterweight. It was a unipolar world. And Larry and Paige and I used to be very close friends, and I would stay at his house, and I would talk to Larry into the late hours of the night about AI safety. And it became apparent to me that Larry did not care about AI safety. I think perhaps the thing that gave it away was when he called me a speciest for being pro-humanity, as in a racist, but for species. So I’m like, “Wait a second, what side are you on, Larry?” And then I’m like, okay, listen, this guy’s calling me a speciest. He doesn’t care about AI safety. We’ve got to have some counterpoint here because this seems like we could be, this is no good.\n",
      "\n",
      "(47:01)\n",
      "So OpenAI was actually started, and it was meant to be open source. I named it OpenAI after open source. It is in fact a closed source, super closed. It should be renamed super closed source for maximum profit AI. Because this is what it actually is. Fay loves irony. In fact, a friend of mine says, the way to predict outcomes is the most ironic outcome is the most… It’s like his Occam’s razor, the simplest explanation is most likely. And my friend Jonah’s view is that the most ironic outcome is the most likely. And that’s what’s happened with OpenAI. It is gone from an open source foundation, a 5123, to suddenly it’s like a $90 billion for-profit corporation with closed source. So I don’t know how you go from here to there.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I don’t know how you get … Is this legal? I’m like, “That’s legal?”\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "That’s correct. Larry refused to be friends with me after I recruited Ilya.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I think we should be concerned about this because I think Ilya actually has a strong moral compass. He really sweats it over questions of what is right. And if Ilya felt strongly enough to want to fire Sam, well, I think the world should know what was that reason.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I’ve reached out, but he doesn’t want to talk to anyone.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I’ve talked to a lot of people. I’ve not found anyone who knows why. Have you?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "One of two things is, either it was a serious thing and we should know what it is or it was not a serious thing and then the board should resign.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I have mixed feelings about Sam. The ring of power can corrupt, and he has the ring of power. So I don’t know. I think I want to know why Ilya felt so strongly as to fire Sam. This sounds like a serious thing. I don’t think it was trivial. And I’m quite concerned that there’s some dangerous element of AI that they’ve created.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "That’d be my guess.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "On the AI front, I’m in somewhat of a quandary here because I’ve thought AI could be something that would change the world in a significant way since I was in college, 30 years ago. Now, the reason I didn’t go build AI right from the get-go was because I was uncertain about which edge of the double-edged sword would be sharper, the good edge or the bad edge.\n",
      "\n",
      "(50:58)\n",
      "So I held off on doing anything on AI, could’ve created, I think, a leading AI company, and OpenAI actually is that, because I was just uncertain, if you make this magic genie, what will happen, whereas I think building sustainable energy technology is much more of a single-edged sword that is single-edged good, making life multi-planetary, I think single-edged good, installing mostly single-edged good, giving people better connectivity to people that don’t have connectivity or it’s too expensive, I think is very much a good thing. Sonic was instrumental, by the way, in halting the Russian advance, and the Ukrainians said so. So I think, with AI, you’ve got the magic genie problem. You may think you want a magic genie, but once that genie’s out of the bottle, it’s hard to say what happens.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The genie is certainly poking its head out.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It’s funny, all these weights, they’re just basically numbers in a common separated value file, and that’s our digital god, the CSP file. I found that funny, but that’s literally what it is. So I think it’s coming pretty fast.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "If you say smarter than the smartest human at anything?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It may not be then quite smarter than all humans, well, machine-augmented humans, because people have got computers and stuff. There’s a higher bar, but you say it’s more than any … can write as good a novel as, say, JK Rowling, or discover new physics, or invent new technology, I would say that we’re less than three years from that point.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah. Data is very important. You could say data is probably more valuable than gold.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yes, X might be the single best source of data. People click on more links to X than anything else on earth. Sometimes people think Facebook or Instagram is a bigger thing, but actually, there are more links to X than anything. This is public information. You can Google it.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So it is where you would find what is happening right now on earth at any given point in time. The whole OpenAI drama played out, in fact, on the X platform. Google certainly has a massive amount of data, so does Microsoft, but it is one of the best sources of data.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, that’s a huge lie.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "These AIs are all trained on copyrighted data, obviously.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "That’s a lie.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah, straight up lie.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "100%. Obviously, it’s been trained on copyrighted data.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It’s one every minute here.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I don’t know, except to say that, by the time these lawsuits are decided, we’ll have digital God. So I’d ask digital God at that point. These lawsuits won’t be decided before, on a timeframe that is relevant.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "There’s that … I don’t know if it’s actually a real Chinese thing or not, but may you live an interesting time is apparently not a good thing, but personally, I would prefer to live in interesting times, and we live in the most interesting of times. For awhile there, I was really getting demotivated and losing sleep over the threat of AI danger, and then I finally became fatalistic about it and said, “Well, even if I knew annihilation was certain, would I choose to be alive at that time or not?” And I said, “I probably would choose to be alive at that time because it’s the most interesting thing, even if there’s nothing I could do about it.” So then basically, a fatalistic resignation helped me sleep at night because I was having trouble sleeping at night because of AI danger.\n",
      "\n",
      "(58:43)\n",
      "Now, what to do about it? I’ve been the one banging the drum the hardest, by far the longest, or at least one of longest for AI danger, and these regulatory things that are happening, the single biggest reason they’re happening is because of me.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Well, there’s regulation around anything which is a physical danger, a danger to the public. So cars are heavily regulated, communications are heavily regulated, rockets and aircraft are heavily regulated. The general philosophy about regulation is that, when something is a danger to the public, that there needs to be some government oversight. So I think, in my view, AI is more dangerous than nuclear bombs and we regulate nuclear bombs. You can’t just go make a nuclear bomb in your backyard. I think we should have some kind of regulation with AI. Now, this tends to cause the AI accelerationist to get up in arms because they think AI is heaven, basically.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "As I said a moment ago, one should not take what is viewed in the media as being the whole picture. There are literally hundreds, this is not an exaggeration, say, there are probably 100 million regulations that my companies comply with and there are probably five that we don’t. And if we disagree with some of those regulations, it’s because we think the regulation that is meant to do good doesn’t actually do good.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It’s not defying regulations for the sake of defiance.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "No, I’m saying you’re fundamentally mistaken, and it should be obvious that you’re mistaken. My company’s automotive is heavily regulated. We would not be allowed to put cars on the road if we did not comply with this vast body of regulation. Now, you could fill up the stage with, literally six foot high, the regulations that you have to comply with to make a car. You could have a room full of phone books. That’s how big the regulations are. And if you don’t comply with all of those, you can’t sell the car. And if we don’t comply with all the regulations for rockets or for Starlink, they shut us down.\n",
      "\n",
      "(01:01:46)\n",
      "So in fact, I am incredibly compliant with regulations. Now, once in awhile, there’ll be something that I disagree with. The reason I would disagree with it is because I think the regulation, in that particular case, in that rare case, does not serve the public good. And therefore, I think it is my obligation to object to a regulation that is meant to serve the public good, but doesn’t. That’s the only time I object, not because I seek to object. In fact, I’m incredibly rule-following.\n",

      "TikTok is-\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I don’t use TikTok.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I don’t personally use it, but for teenagers and people in their 20s, they seem almost religiously addicted to TikTok. Some people will watch TikTok for two hours a day. I stopped using TikTok when I felt the AI probing my mind and it made me uncomfortable, so I stopped using it. And in terms of antisemitic content, TikTok is rife with that. It has the most viral antisemitic content by far.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "No.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I don’t think this is some Chinese Government plot, but the TikTok algorithm is entirely AI-powered. So it is really just trying to find the most viral thing possible. It’s what is going to keep you glued to the screen. That’s it. Now, on sheer numbers, there are on the order of two billion Muslims in the world, and I think a much smaller number of Jewish people, 20 million, something, many orders of magnitude fewer. So if you just look at content production, just on sheer numbers basis, this is going to be overwhelmingly antisemitic, just on a numbers basis.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Have I?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Well, doing nothing to provoke the Biden Administration, they held an electric vehicle summit at the White House and specifically refused to let Tesla attend. This was in the first six months of the administration. And we inquired, we’re like, “We literally make more electric cars than everyone else combined. Why are we not allowed? Why are you only letting Ford, GM, Chrysler, and UAW, and you’re specifically disallowing us from the EV summit at the White House?” We had done nothing to provoke them. Then Biden went on to add insult to injury and publicly said that GM was leading the electric car revolution. This was in the same quarter that Tesla made 300,000 electric cars and GM made 26. Does that seem fair to you?\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And by the way, I had a great relationship with Obama. So this was not a-\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "And it hurt the company, too, and it was an insult to … Tesla has 140,000 employees. Half of them are in the United States. Tesla has created more manufacturing jobs than everyone else combined.\n",

      "Well, I haven’t endorsed anyone for president. I wanted to hear what Vivek had to say because I think that some of the things he says, I think, are pretty solid. He’s concerned about government overreach, about government control of information. The degree to which old Twitter was basically a sock puppet of the government was ridiculous. So it seems to me that there’s a very severe violation of the First Amendment in terms of how much control the government had over old Twitter, and it no longer does.\n",
      "\n",
      "(01:08:04)\n",
      "So there’s a reason for the First Amendment. The reason for the First Amendment, for freedom of speech, is because the people that immigrated to this country came from places where there was not freedom of speech. And they were like, “You know what? We got to make sure that that’s constitutional,” because where they came from, if they said something, they’d be put in prison or something bad would happen to them. And freedom of speech, you have to say, when is it relevant? It’s only relevant when someone you don’t like can say something you don’t like or it has no meaning. And as soon as you throw in the towel and concede to censorship, it is only a matter of time before someone censors you. And that is why we have the First Amendment.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "No, I think that’s outrageous. I’m not going to vote for some pro-censorship candidate. Like I said, I think you have to consider that there’s a lot of wisdom in these amendments, I mean, the constitution, and a lot of things that we take for granted here in the United States that don’t even exist in Canada. There’s no constitutional right to freedom of speech in Canada and there’s no Miranda rights in Canada. People think you have the right to remain silent. You don’t, actually, in Canada. I’m half Canadian, I can say these things, I suppose. So the freedom of speech is incredibly important, even when people … And like I said, it’s actually especially important, in fact, it is only relevant, when people you don’t like can say things you don’t like. [inaudible 01:10:40] they’re meaningless.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Look, we actually are in an odd situation here where, on balance, the Democrats appear to be more pro-censorship than the Republicans, and that used to be the opposite. It used to be left position was freedom of speech. I believe, at one point, the ACLU even defended the right of someone to claim that they were Nazi or something like that. So the left was freedom of speech is fundamental. My perception, perhaps it isn’t accurate, is that the pro-censorship is more on the left than the right.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "… We certainly get more complaints from the left than the right, let me put it that way. But my aspiration for the X platform is that it is the best source of truth, or the least inaccurate source of truth.

      "And we’ve got this great system, and it’s getting better, called Community Notes, which is fantastic I think at correcting falsehoods, or adding context. In fact, we make a point of not removing anything, but only adding context. Now that context could include that this is completely false and here’s why. And no one is immune to this. I’m not immune to it. Advertisers are not immune to it. In fact, we’ve had Community Notes, which has caused us some loss in advertising. Speaking of loss in advertising revenue. If a community note… If there’s false advertising, the Community Note will say, “This is false and here is why.”\n",

So I mean there’s a lot of people who are out there who think the top 10 car company’s is going to be Tesla followed by nine Chinese car companies. I think they might not be wrong. So China is super good at manufacturing, and the work ethic is incredible. So if we consider different leagues of competitiveness at Tesla, we consider the Chinese league to be the most competitive. And by the way, we do very well in China because our China team is the best in China.\n",

      "Well, I mean I think it’s generally not good to have an adversarial relationship between people on the line, one group at the company and another group. In fact, I disagree with the idea of unions, but perhaps for a reason that is different than people may expect, which is I just don’t like anything which creates kind of a lords and peasants sort of thing.

So I’m no stranger to them. And there are actually many times where I’ve said, “Well, can’t we just hold a union vote?” But apparently a company is not allowed to hold a union vote, so it has to be somehow called for, but the unions can’t do it. So I said, “Well let’s just hold a vote and see what happens.”\n",

And in fact, we’ve now had monkeys with Neuralink implants for two, three years and they’re doing great. And we’ve even replaced the Neuralink twice and we’re getting ready to do the first implants, hopefully in a few months. The only implementations of Neuralink I think are unequivocally good. Speaking of the double-edged sword, I think these early implementations are single-edged sword, because the first implementations will be to enable people who have lost the brain-body connection to be able to operate a computer or a phone faster than someone who has hands that work. So you can imagine if Stephen Hawking could communicate faster than someone who had full-body functionality, how incredible that would be. Well, that’s what this device will do, and we should have proof of that in a human, hopefully in a few months.\n",

So it’s like if somebody has lost both eyes, or the optic nerve has failed, basically where they have no possibility of having some ocular correction. That would be the next thing for Neuralink, is a direct vision interface. And in fact, then you could be like Geordi La Forge from Star Trek.

      "Yes. Well, first of all, humans are terrible drivers. So people text and drive, they drink and drive, they get into arguments, they do all sorts of things in cars that they should not do. So it’s actually remarkable that there are not more deaths than there are. What we’ll find with computer driving is, I think probably an order of magnitude reduction in deaths.\n",
      "\n",
      "(01:28:45)\n",
      "And the US has actually far fewer deaths per capita than the rest of the world. If you go worldwide, I think there’s something close to a million deaths per year due to automotive accidents. So I think computer driving will probably drop that by 90% or more. It won’t be perfect, but it’ll be 10 times better.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Well, in large numbers, it will simply be so obviously true that it really cannot be denied.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Sure, of course. Wait, I shouldn’t have said that. So yeah, I’m optimistic about… I think I’m naturally optimistic about time scales, and if I was not naturally optimistic, I wouldn’t be doing the things that I’m doing. I mean, I certainly wouldn’t have sold a rocket company or electric car company if I didn’t have some sort of pathological optimism, frankly.\n",
      "\n",
      "(01:30:04)\n",
      "So as you pointed out, many people said that it would fail. And in fact, actually I agreed with them. I said, “Yes, it probably will fail.” And they’re like, “Hmm, okay.” But I thought SpaceX and Tesla had less than a 10% chance of success when we started them. So yeah, anyway. But the self-driving thing is, I’ve been optimistic about it, but we’ve certainly made a lot of progress. If anybody has tried, has been using the sort of full self-driving beta, the progress every year has been substantial.\n",
      "\n",
      "(01:30:42)\n",
      "It’s really now at the point where in most places it’ll take you from one place to another with no interventions. And the data is unequivocal that supervised full self-driving is somewhere around four times safer or maybe more, than just a human driving by themselves. So I can certainly see it coming. Actually, really-\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "No, no, no, definitely not. Definitely not.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Well, I mean I think they’ve all, with rare exception, thought it wasn’t happening. So they were investing, despite thinking, they’re very clear that they don’t think it’s real. So they’re not saying, “Oh, we just believe everything Elon says, hook, line, and sinker.” But the thing is that, I mean, it would be a fair criticism of me to say that I’m late, but I always deliver in the end.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Well, I think it’s quite literally-\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Well, I was encouraging people to amplify empathy, literally. I tend to be quite literal.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I think I was talking to some friends, and we all agreed that we should try to amplify empathy. And so I wrote amplify empathy.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Look, sometimes it’s pretty simple.\n",
