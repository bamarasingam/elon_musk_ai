["Hello, everyone. My apologies for the late start. We unfortunately had a massive distributed denial of service attack against our servers and saturated all of our data lines, like basically hundreds of gigabits of data were saturated.\nWe think we've overcome most of that, and so it's now time to proceed. But as this massive attack illustrates, there's a lot of opposition to people just hearing what President Trump has to say. And so, but I'm honored to have this conversation.\nI want to emphasize it's a conversation, and it's really intended to just get a feel for what Donald Trump is just like in a conversation. It's hard to catch a vibe about someone if you just don't hear them talk in a normal way. And when there's an adversarial interview, like no one's themselves in an adversarial interview.\nSo, and this is really aimed at kind of open-minded, independent voters who are just trying to make up their mind. And so you can understand like, what is it just like to have a conversation? So, honored to, Donald, great to speak.\nWe had a great conversation yesterday. As you mentioned yesterday, if we could just record that conversation and post it, it would have been excellent. And I hope we can have something like that today.", "Well, thank you. Well, maybe we could start off with, I mean, the assassination attempt, which was an incredible thing. And I have to say that your actions after that assassination attempt were inspiring. Instead of shying away from things, instead of ducking down, you were pumping your fist in the air and saying, fight, fight, fight.\nAnd I think that's, I mean, the president of the United States represents America. And I think that is America, that is strength under fire. And so that's a big, part of the reason why I was excited to endorse you as the president of the United States for having another term here is that was just incredibly inspiring.\nBut I mean, what was it like for you?", "Not pleasant.", "Much blood.", "I mean, maybe it's a sign. Maybe that's a sign, you know.", "You highlighted a serious issue at that moment. That's right. The bullet, you know, hit your ear.\nBut, you know, missed your head.", "Well, I mean, that's clearly, you know, he was very competent in taking that shot to stop the attempted assassination. But I mean, there does seem to be, I mean, some pretty significant failings elsewhere in the system. Like, there's just no way that, like, how on earth does a shooter get on a roof 130 yards away?\nThat seems crazy. I think most people are wondering how on earth could such a thing happen.", "Yeah, yeah, yeah.", "I mean, it's like, I'm just, I guess, I mean, for my part, and I think probably many members of the public are wondering how the heck are, you know, basically people wandering by pointing out there's a guy on the roof with a gun. Yeah. They're seeing it, but somehow it's not being addressed.\nThat does seem crazy.", "Yeah, it's not a tough shot.", "I mean, looking at the aerial views, that building would be, like, the number one spot for a sniper. I mean, it's like, if you were to pick, like, what is the favorite, what if you, so if the goal is to assassinate, what's your favorite spot? That building.\nYou're right. That building would be number one.", "It's like, you couldn't ask for a better location. It's like, number one.", "But he totally would have hit if you hadn't turned your head, so like, you know, there was a, it was a very near thing.", "Exactly.", "You'd be talking to me from another realm, perhaps.", "Well, it was, I think your actions in the heat of fire, and, you know, like what I find admirable there was that you can't fake bravery under such circumstances. The courage is instinctual or it is not. It's not a rehearsed action.\nAnd so I just want to say that I think a lot of people admire your courage under fire there. And yeah, so...", "It was a terrible thing, but it was incredibly moving, yeah. Well, and I mean, speaking of the sort of slide that got you to turn, that saved your life really, was the illegal immigration slide. Maybe this is worth talking about, about that.\nIt was, it was. That slide, that slide saved your life.", "I mean, that's a great one. Saved by illegal immigration.", "Well, what were you about to say about illegal immigration before you were rudely interrupted?", "Yeah, so rudely interrupted by an assassination attempt.", "Some people have no manners.", "Well, I mean, would it be accurate to say that you're supportive of legal immigration, but we obviously need to shut down illegal immigration and especially unvetted illegal immigration because, you know, and that's not the same as saying that everyone who's an illegal immigrant is bad. In fact, I think most people who are illegal immigrants are actually good, but you can't tell the difference unless there's a solid vetting of who comes across the border. Does that actually represent your position?", "Yeah, no, I think it is essential to have a secure border. I mean, you're really not a country unless you have a secure border.", "Yeah, absolutely, secure elections. And so it's just essential to have a real border, or we can't function as a country. And our central services are being overwhelmed in a lot of cities.\nBut as we were talking about earlier, I think having a legal immigration process that is smooth and efficient and done well, and I'm speaking as someone who is a legal immigrant, and I think that, I mean, like one way to think of it is who do you want on your team? Like who do you want on Team America? And I think we wanna just say, okay, we wanna let in people who are gonna be great contributors to our society and to our economy, and who do you want on the team?\nAnd it's not to say that, like in my opinion, actually, I'd say like probably most of the illegal immigrants actually are good, hardworking people. That's my opinion. But some are not.\nAnd you just have this sort of adverse selection process where if somebody has a career in theft or robbery, I don't understand what's taken them so long to get here because we're in such a target-rich environment. I mean, why aren't more people who have a career in bad things coming here sooner? Because it's, I mean, it's a piece of cake to go rob houses in L.A. or New York compared to other parts of the world. And in a lot of places in America, if you try to stop the person who's robbing you, you'll be arrested, so it's not fair.", "It's simply not working. No, it's horrible. Whether it's a question of intention or competence, either way, we don't have a secure border and we have people streaming over like it looks like a World War Z zombie apocalypse at times.\nAnd, you know, sometimes you gotta sort of wonder, like, is it real or not? You know, because you see things and you're like, is it real? So I went to the border at Eagle Pass and I saw for myself in Texas.\nAnd I was like, okay, it's real. I'm like seeing this in real time. I actually posted the video, like just live.\nI just flew there one day and just to see, hey, is this made up or real? And I'm just seeing people stream across the border. And I have to say, you know, at least the people that I saw did not look friendly.\nYou know, so people can look at my video and say, hey, you know, these people look friendly. They don't look super friendly, so...", "Yeah, no, no. We have 20 million people in the border.", "Yeah, I think this, frankly, I think this is a fundamental existential issue for the United States. And if we have another four more years of open borders, and it's gonna be even worse, with another four more years, it's gonna be even worse than it's been for the past three and a half years. I'm not sure we've got a country.", "This is a super important point. Like, people, it's like, well, basically, when I went down there, I was like, well, where are people from? It's like almost no one was from Mexico.\nNo, Mexico less than the Earth. It's just the border with Mexico, but the people coming in, it's Earth, the rest of Earth. And America is only, you know, about 4 or 5% of the population of Earth. It would only take a few percent of the rest of Earth to overwhelm everything in the world.", "It's just an everywhere on Earth thing, and it's just not possible for the United States to absorb everyone from Earth, or even a few percent of the rest of Earth. It's just not possible.", "Yeah, I mean, they just took him out back behind the shed and basically shot him.", "Yeah, I think you're making an excellent point here, which is that when other countries that are thinking about invading or doing bad things, when they're thinking about that, they're thinking about, okay, what's the American president gonna do? And do they fear the American president? Or is there someone they do not respect and do not fear?\nAnd I think they would rightfully be, I mean, look at the footage of the assassination. They're like, okay, President Trump is like, don't mess with me. I mean, that's like, whereas I think people are not gonna be, and they obviously have not been at all intimidated by Biden.\nAnd they certainly will not be intimidated by Kamala. And you have to really think about it in the context of global security. That if the American president is someone that like evil dictators are scared of, that makes a huge difference to the security of the world.", "Yeah, it doesn't make any sense. It's like, it's inconsistent, certainly. But I mean, I think it's just worth emphasizing to listeners that the immense importance of whether the United States president is intimidating or not intimidating and how much that matters to global security.\nBecause there's some real tough characters out there. And if they don't think the American president is tough, they will do what they wanna do. I know every one of them.\nAnd that puts the whole world in danger.", "Those were some epic tweets, by the way.", "Yes, I mean, it's because people like Kim Jong-un, they respond to strength, not weakness.", "I think you're right. I think people underrate the risk of World War III. And it's just, when looking at the risk of global thermonuclear warfare, it's game over for humanity.\nAnd it's something that people have, I think after the end of the Cold War, people have become complacent about, but they actually have forgotten that there are currently a lot of nuclear missiles that have targeting parameters for the United States and other countries.", "No, they could not.", "Yes, absolutely.", "Yeah, a lot of people just don't understand where inflation comes from. Inflation comes from government overspending because the checks never bounce when it's written by the government. So if the government spends far more than it brings in, that increases the money supply.\nAnd if the money supply increases faster than the rate of goods and services, that's inflation. So really, we need to reduce our government spending and we need to re-examine. I think we need like a government efficiency commission to say like, hey, where are we spending money that's sensible, where is it not sensible?\nAnd we need to live within our means. We're currently adding, I think a trillion dollars to the deficit every, roughly every hundred days. And the interest payments on the national debt have now exceeded the defense budget.\nIt's on the order of a trillion dollars.", "And it keeps growing.", "Sure. Well, just going back to this basic thing, which is that people try to make it sound complicated, but it's not, but inflation is caused by government overspending. Would you agree that we need to take a look at government spending and have, perhaps, a government efficiency commission that just tries to make the spending sensible and so that the country lives within its means, just like a person does?", "Multiply it by a million. Yeah, the numbers are astronomical.", "Well, I mean, if, so, I mean, I mean, I think it would be great to just have a government efficiency commission that takes a look at these things and just ensures that the taxpayer money, to the taxpayers' hard-earned money is spent in a good way. And I'd be happy to help out on such a commission.", "If it were formed.", "Well, I'd be happy to help out.", "Yeah, well, it's just from government overspending and not just not spending taxpayer money effectively. And having, you know, just like so many departments, you can't even name them all. And what Malay is doing is, you know, he's cutting government spending.\nHe's simplifying things. He's putting in regulations that make sense. And Argentina overnight is experiencing a giant improvement in prosperity.\nBut it's also a lesson for the United States, which is that Argentina used to be one of the most prosperous countries in the world. You know, I think in the 30s, 40s. And because of bad government policy, it ruined the country.\nAnd if you take Venezuela, for example, Venezuela should be incredibly prosperous. They have, you know, phenomenal reserves of everything, oil, everything. And it should be prosperous.\nBut if the government's wrong, it impoverishes the people. And so I think we should not be complacent in the United States and thinking that and taking our prosperity for granted, because with bad government policy, we can run the country into the ground. And that's just something people should bear in mind.\nDon't take prosperity for granted.", "Yeah. I think you're making a good point in that if the states have to, if each individual, if each state has to compete against other states, then people will naturally move to states where it's better.", "Sure, yeah. No, but I mean, I mean, some of these governors are doing so badly. I mean, they got so many people moving out of their state, they should get U-Haul Salesman of the Year Award because they're driving so much U-Haul.", "It's just people moving out.", "I mean, I think the thing that's, the only thing that's gonna force some of these states to change is if they risk bankruptcy and they're not getting bailed out by the federal government.", "That's the only thing that's gonna get them changed.", "Well, I think that, I mean, that larger point here too, as you're saying, you know, a lot of people are concerned about the economy. A lot of people are concerned about inflation. And inflation is effectively a tax on people that save money and for people that are working day to day.\nIt's just a form of taxation. And if we can solve the government spending problem, we'll solve the inflation problem, which means people will have a better standard of living. And that's a really big deal.", "I think it really just comes, like I said, I think it just comes down to really, I guess really two things, which is, is that if you solve government overspending, you solve inflation, which improves living standards of the average person. And then if you deregulate, like have sensible regulations, because a lot of the regulations are nonsensical and cause the cost to be extreme for no reason. But unless you've got effective deregulation, like Reagan did a great job on deregulation in the 80s, but it's been 40 years since we haven't had anyone really, I mean, during your administration, we made some progress, but I think there's an opportunity to make, I think, radical progress with sensible regulation.\nAnd if you, those two things, yeah. Those are the big deals.", "Yeah, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I should probably say something about like, you know, maybe my views on, you know, climate change and oil and gas, because I think I'm probably different from what most people would assume.\nBecause my views are actually pretty, I think moderate in this regard, which is that I don't think we should vilify the oil and gas industry and the people that have worked very hard in those industries to provide the necessary energy to support the economy. And if we were to stop using oil and gas right now, we would all be starving and the economy would collapse. So it's, you know, I don't think it's right to sort of vilify the oil and gas industry.\nAnd I, you know, the world has a certain demand for oil and gas and it's probably better if the United States provides that than some other countries. And it would help with prosperity in the US. And at the same time, obviously my view is like, we do over time wanna move to a sustainable energy economy because eventually you do run out of, I mean, you run out of oil and gas.\nIt's not there, it's not infinite. And there is some risk. I think it's not, the risk is not as high as, you know, a lot of people say it is with respect to global warming.\nBut I think if you just keep increasing the cost per million in the atmosphere long enough, eventually it actually simply gets uncomfortable to breathe. People don't realize this. If you go past a thousand parts per million of CO2, you start getting headaches and nausea.\nAnd so we're now in the sort of 400 range. We're adding, I think about roughly two parts per million per year. So, I mean, it still gives us, so what it means is like, we still have quite a bit of time, but so there's not like, we don't need to rush and we don't need to like, you know, stop farmers from farming or, you know, prevent people from having steaks or basic stuff like that.\nLike leave the farmers alone.", "Yeah. Well, I mean, my estimate would be, you know, a little more aggressive than that, but it's not the sort of like, we're all gonna die in five years stuff. That's obviously BS.\nBut I mean, my view is like, if you just look at sort of the parts per million that increments every year, you know, you get sort of two or three parts per million every year of CO2. I mean, I think some of that, it's problematic if it accelerates, if you start going from two or three to say five. And then there may be some situations where you get a step change increase in the CO2.\nAnd I think we don't wanna get too close to 1000 PPM because like that's actually makes it uncomfortable to breathe. Like just existing in 1000 PPM CO2 is uncomfortable. That's like a, that's considered like an industrial hazard.\nJust so it's, you know, that's actually, you start getting headaches and stuff. So it's even without global warming, it's not comfortable to live. So you don't wanna get too close to that.\nBut I mean, I think we've got, I think we wanna just move over. And like if, I don't know, 50 to 100 years from now, we're, I don't know, mostly sustainable. I think that'll probably be okay.\nSo it's not like the house is on fire immediately, but I think it is something we need to move towards. And on, you know, on balance, it's probably better to move there faster than slower. But like I said, without vilifying the oil and gas industry and without causing hardship in the short term, I think this can be done with without, you know, people can still have, you know, a stake and they can still drive gasoline cars.\nAnd this, you know, it's okay. It's like, it's not, I don't think we should vilify people first, but I think we should just generally lean in the direction of sustainability. And I actually think solar is gonna be a majority of earth's energy generation in the future.\nAnd it's certainly trending that way. And so you get the solar power, mind that with batteries. So because obviously the sun doesn't shine at night and then you use that to charge the electric cars and you have a long-term sustainable solution.\nAnd, you know, that's what Tesla is trying to move things towards. And I think we've made a lot of progress in that regard. But when you look at our cars, like we don't believe that environmentalism, that caring about the environment should mean that you have to suffer.\nSo we make sure that our cars are beautiful, that they drive well, that they're fast, they're, you know, sexy. I mean, they're cool. In fact, literally, I mean, the sexy joke, Model S, Model 3, Model X and Y spells out sexy.\nIt's probably the most expensive joke out there. But I, you know, I just, I don't know, I like cheesy humor, you know? So, but I'm a big fan of like, let's have an inspiring future and let's work towards, you know, a better future.\nAnd we can do so without demonizing people. Right, I'm okay.", "Yeah, and actually, there's the bad side of nuclear, which is a nuclear war, very bad side. But there's also, I think, nuclear electricity generation is underrated. And it's actually, you know, people have this fear of nuclear electricity generation, but it's actually one of the safest forms of electricity generation.\nIt's just a huge misunderstanding. And if you look at the injuries and deaths caused by, say, I mean, I'm not gonna try to pick on coal mining, but just any kind of mining operation. And there's a certain number of injuries and deaths per year.\nI mean, you compare that to nuclear, nuclear is actually way better. So it's underrated as an electricity source. And I think it's something that's worth reconsidering, but there's so much regulation that people can't get it done.", "No, that's not true.", "It's the basics. It's actually not that bad. So like after Fukushima happened in Japan, like people were asking me in California, you know, are we worried about like a nuclear cloud coming from Japan?\nI'm like, no, that's crazy. It's actually, it's not even dangerous in Fukushima. I actually flew there and ate locally grown vegetables on TV to prove it.\nAnd I donated a solar water treatment, yeah, it's a solar powered system for a water treatment plant.", "But I mean... It's fine, you know. It's like, you know, Hiroshima and Nagasaki were bombed, but now they're like full cities again.\nSo it's really not something that, you know.", "So it's not as scary as people think basically, but let's see. I mean, are there some other topics we should touch on? Oh, you know, like lawfare.\nI think, you know, we need to be concerned about... Obviously.", "Well, it's clearly, I mean, it's clearly like we just don't have a president.", "Yeah, this is simply not true.", "No, I mean, obviously what's happening sort of overnight is they're rewriting history and making Kamala sound like a moderate when in fact she is far left, like far, far left.", "Yeah, no, no. I mean, Netanyahu came to give a talk to a joint Senate and House sitting, and I was there and Kamala stood him up. You know, what does that say?", "I think you're right. I mean, it's important for the public that may be listening to this to say, to look at Kamala's track record, you know, before the last like month and say, is that a track record you agree with? And I think if you're an independent moderate, you definitely would not agree with it because it is, her behavior has been far left.\nAnd we're seeing just an overnight propaganda attempt to rewrite history and make it sound like Kamala's moderate when she in fact is not moderate.", "I think we're in massive trouble, frankly, with the Kamala administration, and that's my honest opinion. And I think really it's essential that you won for the good of the country this election. And I mean, that's understating my opinion.\nNow, you may have seen this, but I got a letter from the EU Commission like saying to not have disinformation during this discussion that we're having. And there's a lot of attempts to do censorship and to force censorship even on Americans from other countries. And what do you think about that?", "I think a lot of the public isn't aware of the fact that the United States pays a disproportionate share of the NATO expenses.", "Yeah, well, I mean, the point of NATO is defending Europe and it's, you know, it's like, okay, well, why is the United States paying disproportionately more to defend Europe than Europe? That doesn't make sense, that's unfair. And that is an appropriate thing to address.", "Yeah, well, I think it's obvious that you're a believer and an advocate of free speech because during your first time as president, you were attacked relentlessly every day, often very unfairly with false attacks. And you didn't try to shut down the media. You didn't try to inhibit their freedom of speech.\nAnd I think that says a lot.", "That's true.", "This is a really big point. You can actually have a conversation with you. Yeah, it's nice, isn't it?\nAnd you can't have a conversation with Biden or Kamala. It's like not, it's not possible. Yeah, it's true.\nSo this is like talking to an NPC, so it's just impossible.", "Yeah, that's for sure.", "Yeah, well, you know, maybe like, I think it's part of what people in America wanna, you know, people in America wanna feel excited and inspired about the future. They wanna feel like the future is gonna be better than the past. And that America is gonna do things that are greater than we've done in the past, reach new heights that make you proud to be an American and excited about the future.\nThey want the American dream back.", "Yeah, it was just absurd. But I mean, I think there are like, you know, some grand projects that we could do. I mean, I think like, you know, we could build a base on the moon.\nWe could send American astronauts to Mars. We could build high-speed connections that are more advanced than anything else in the world between our cities. So people have fast transport.\nYou know, it's possible to solve traffic with tunnels. We've, you know, we already made great progress in Vegas doing that. And, you know, and just do things that are exciting and inspiring and make the future feel like it's better than the past.", "No, it's straightforward.", "So, and like, I think we could do some things that like, like China's got incredible high-speed rail between its cities. But I think it's actually possible with tunnels. If it was deregulation with an ability to actually, where it's like legal to actually do the tunnels, then you could have high-speed tunnels that are actually better than anything else in the world for high-speed transport between cities.\nAnd that would be something that, you know, Americans can say, wow, okay, we've got something that's cooler than anyone else in the world. That's the kind of thing that makes you proud to be an American.", "Yeah, and I think also like there's, you know, I just, I'm kind of hopping on the excess regulation, but I think something that I think people can generally understand is that what happens with laws and regulations is that they just, there's more and more of them every year. And unless there's a process to clean them up, eventually everything becomes illegal. And that actually, it slows down the development of new technologies.\nI mean, if you take the sort of, like I think there's room for some reform at the FDA for improving the speed with which we approve drugs that could help save lives and improve people's lives.", "Yeah, it just takes too long, and you end up in the same with the approval, but it just, you know, it takes years instead of something that I think could potentially take months that improves people's lives. I think, you know, but I just wanted to hop on this point that like there has to be an active process for reducing rules and regulations because otherwise they just keep building up every year and you get like hardening of the arteries, and eventually everything's illegal or takes forever. And then we just ossify as a society we just, we can't make any progress.\nAnd that's, it's a really big deal.", "Well, I mean, and actually to give you some props here, it's like if a drug is approved in Europe, which has a crazy amount of regulations, it should obviously be approved in the US. I mean, they got more regulations than we do. So why would a drug be approved in Europe and not in the US?\nThat's crazy.", "Absolutely.", "And I think as long as people are properly informed of the pros and cons and like, these are the risks, this is the risk.\nAnd like, you make your own decision. That makes sense.", "Well, I think actually in terms of the number of people that will hear this conversation over the next few days, two weeks, it's going to be hundreds.", "I mean, with all these things, I always try to get to the ground truth by just asking people. And my mom lives in New York. And I was like, mom, have any of your friends been attacked or assaulted?\nAnd she said, yeah, three of her friends in three separate incidents were assaulted just in recent months, just walking around the streets of New York. And I said, well, what happened to the people that assaulted them? Oh, nothing, they got away.\nLike, and they just know- They always get away. Nothing's gonna, and they don't even bother reporting it because they know that there's not, they're not gonna, you know, people are not gonna get prosecuted. They just let, you know, violent criminals out in New York.", "Yeah, I mean, it's just obviously messed up if violent criminals are being getting off scot-free. And meanwhile, New York's spending massive resources prosecuting you. And it's like, what's this?\nYou know, and I think the sort of sensible public looks at this and says, what the heck's going on here? This is obviously abuse of the legal system. You know, the legal system is supposed to be protecting the public from violent criminals.\nAnd it should be obviously allowing the public to make their own decision about who should be president as opposed to, you know, some, you know, legal case.", "Absolutely.", "It's kind of you to say, thank you.", "Thank you. And well, I mean, I just say, here's to an exciting, inspiring future that people can look forward to and be optimistic and excited about what happens next. And that's the kind of future that I think you will bring as president and that's why I endorse you.", "I think that's a very real risk.", "It's a very real risk. And, you know, I'd just like to note to people listening, I've not been very political before. And if you look at my record, I've actually been, I'm not like, sometimes they try to paint me as like a far right guy, which is absurd because I like making electric vehicles and, you know, solar and batteries, helping them with the environment.\nAnd I actually, you know, I supported Obama. I stood in line for six hours to shake Obama's hand when he was running for president. And, you know, so it's not like I'm like some sort of dyed-in-the-wool long-term Republican.\nI'm actually, I call myself, you know, historically a moderate Democrat. But now I feel like we're really at a critical juncture for the country. And, you know, I think a lot of people thought, you know, that Biden administration would be a moderate administration, but it's not.\nAnd obviously, we're just gonna see an even further left administration with Kamala. That's my honest opinion. I mean, her dad is literally, I mean, she was brought up as an actual, her dad is a Marxist economist.\nThat's, you can Google it. I mean, it's not a, we're not making this up, you know. That's how she was brought up.\nSo, and we just, we wanna have a future that is prosperous. And I think we're just at this critical juncture. And I think this is a case of the, America is kind of at a fork in the road.\nAnd I think it will take the path, like you are the path to prosperity. And I think Kamala is the opposite. Then that's my, I mean, that's my honest opinion.\nI'm gonna get attacked like crazy. And, you know, I've also experienced quite a bit of lawfare myself. And, but I'm just trying to tell people my honest opinion.\nAnd I haven't been active in, really active in politics before. And I'm just trying to point out that my track record historically has been moderate, if not moderate, slightly left. And so this is to people out there who are in the moderate camp to say, I think you should support Donald Trump for president.\nAnd I think it's actually a very important junction in the road. And we're in deep trouble if it goes the other way.", "Yeah, I mean, if I could summarize it perhaps, you know, I think these are issues that I think most people in America would agree with, which is that we want safe and clean cities. We want secure borders. We want sensible government spending.\nWe want to restore both the perception and the reality of respect in the judicial system, just, you know, stop the lawfare. And I think that's like, and how are those even right-wing positions? I think those are just, that's just common sense.\nAnd that's, I mean, would you agree with that?", "Well, absolutely. And it's obviously demoralizing if you're a police officer risking your life to arrest violent criminals who could kill you and do kill you sometimes. And then you arrest the violent criminal and then the DA doesn't prosecute and that's let the guy out.\nWell, then why should a police officer risk their life to arrest a violent felon?", "Well, I thought it was very telling, like incredibly telling that when there was a case where sort of a gang of thugs beat up police officers. I think it was in Times Square in New York. And then nothing happened to those guys.\nThey were let out, zero bail. And I think a bunch of them were given free tickets to California. Well, I mean, that is a gross indignity against the United States.\nAnd that's how, I mean, this is insane. Like, have we lost all pride? How can such a thing be allowed to occur?", "Yeah, we just cannot have a situation where our police officers would be beaten up on camera by a gang of illegal immigrants and then nothing happens to the guys that beat up the cops. I mean, and they're let out. This is unacceptable.", "Yeah, yeah. So it's just gotta be done. We just can't have, whether they're citizens or not citizens, we can't have, because they won't prosecute citizens either, not just illegals.\nSo you can't have violent, repeat violent offenders that are not, that don't get incarcerated. That's right. Because they will obviously, by definition, continue to hurt people.\nAnd I think where part of this comes from is that this, and I do sort of consider myself liberal in some ways. I mean, it's just that you wanna have empathy for people. Obviously you wanna have empathy for people.\nI totally agree with that. You wanna have empathy, but you also have to have empathy for the victims of the criminals. And if you just have empathy for the criminals, it's actually shallow empathy.\nIt's not real. You're not thinking. You have one layer deep empathy.\nYou gotta say like, if you don't incarcerate this person, who are they going to hurt? They might kill someone. They might rape someone.\nIf you don't incarcerate them, you have to have empathy for the victims. And there's a lack of empathy for the victims of the criminals and too much empathy for the criminals. It doesn't make sense.\nThat's why you wanna have deep empathy for society as a whole, not shallow empathy for criminals.", "The facts speak for themselves.", "The facts speak for themselves. It's gotten to the point where people just don't even bother reporting crime in a lot of cities because they know nothing is gonna happen. That's what I hear anecdotally from people all the time.\nSo, it's just, my values, I'm just saying to people out there, the things I think are important for the future is we've gotta have safe cities. We've gotta have secure borders. We've gotta have sensible spending.\nAnd we've gotta have deregulation. And so we can have a prosperous future. And then we wanna have some exciting sort of moonshot projects that people can get fired up about.\nAnd that's the future I'm looking for. And I'm pro-environment, but I'm not against, I don't think we should vilify the oil and gas industry because they're keeping civilization going right now. But I do think we wanna move at a reasonable speed towards a sustainable energy economy.\nThose are my values. And I think, so, I mean, that's why I'm supporting you for president.", "No, I think we're at a fork in the road of destiny of civilization. And I think we need to take the right path. And I think you're the right path.\nSo I think that's what it comes down to.", "All right, sounds good. Thank you.", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Yeah, it\u2019s about three times the size of the Pentagon. We built it in 16 months.

So it is the number one way that people actually are informed about any kind of news, meaning real time events is on the X platform, formally Twitter, there\u2019s nothing even close for real time news. So we also want to expand upon that and we have done so with the long form content. So instead of just doing what you used to call tweets, you can do long form posts. You can post an entire essay. In fact, you can now put an entire book, post an entire book to the platform. You can do long form video content, so you can do up to four hour video segments. We really want news in whatever form it is, or information I should say, in whatever form it is to be available on our platform, whether it\u2019s short, long, text, pictures, video, whatever the case may be.", "Yeah.", "I just mean that we want to make sure that there are a wide variety of viewpoints that\u2026 We obviously have, for example, Tucker Carlson, who most people will view as being on the Right, and that\u2019s quite a prominent name on the Right. We want to have prominent names on the Left as well, to provide different views of points of view, as well as centrist. Just basically a wide range of viewpoints on the platform so users can hear different opinions. They can hear what\u2019s your point of view, what\u2019s Tucker\u2019s point of view, and people can make their own decision about what they believe.", "I thought you were on the Left, but I know, I\u2019m used\u2026 Let\u2019s just say, I don\u2019t know what the Left is or the Right is, frankly these days because things can be quite polarized. But my impression was that you\u2019re more likely to be described as on the Left than the Right. My sense is you\u2019re sort of center Left. I don\u2019t know, you tell me.", "I saw segment. CNN is generally considered Left, yeah.", "Why do I say CNN is generally considered Left? I think if you look at any sort of media survey of what is on the Left or Right, I think they would say, for example, Fox is on the Right and CNN is on the Left.", "Am I missing something here?", "Sure. Well, how would you describe yourself?", "Well, I agree with that approach. I think that\u2019s generally how people should take things, which is, there are a whole set of issues which are somewhat arbitrarily bucketed into Right or Left, but I think most citizens would think that they would agree with some things on the Left, but not everything, or they would agree with some things on the Right, but not everything. So that\u2019s what I think most people would feel, I guess.", "It\u2019s definitely always going to be X.", "I think it\u2019s going pretty well so far. We\u2019re seeing record usage. We\u2019ve added a tremendous amount of functionality. I mentioned that it used to be that you can only do a short text and maybe a picture or something like that, a short video, but now you can do long form text, long form video. We\u2019ve added audio video calling, so you can not just do text, DMs, you can do [inaudible 00:07:31] video calling.

I\u2019d put it in the nonsense category.

It\u2019s the internet, people will do\u2026 I mean, I\u2019ve been called every name times a thousand.", "I certainly don\u2019t think it\u2019s Right. The old school Twitter suspended and suppressed accounts that you\u2019d call on the Right, 10 times more than they did on accounts on the Left. And even when they did suspend an account on the Left, it was because of arguments between two people on the Left. The political donations of old Twitter were 99% Democrat. Does that sound Left wing or Right wing to you?", "Yes. You know when they look at donations from a company, if a company donates\u2026 Literally 99% of all donations are to Democrats, does that strike you as a Left-leaning or a Right-leaning company?", "What I\u2019m trying to tell you is that Twitter employees, people at Twitter, their political donations were 99%, literally 99% to Democrats.

It was the bestselling car despite being, I think around 50% more expensive than the next bestselling vehicle, of any kind, not just electric. So I think that\u2019s a testament to the incredible work of the Tesla team. And we launched the Cybertruck. Obviously that\u2019s being very well received. We have I think over a million orders for the Cybertruck. So it\u2019s a really special product. I think the Cybertruck is one of those products that comes along really once in several years, maybe once a decade. The Cybertruck is a once a decade product. It is so special and I think it\u2019s our best product.", "Yeah, yeah.

It\u2019s not out of the question.", "No, I got to reserve the cool stuff for when we actually unveil it, but it is going to be really cool. It\u2019s going to have some rocket technology in it.

From an investor standpoint, if there is something I\u2019m taking, I should keep taking it.", "I should say, the reason I mentioned the ketamine prescription on the X platform was because I thought maybe this is something that could help other people. That\u2019s why I mentioned it.", "Right. You\u2019re conflating two things. One is great replacement theory. The other is, which I don\u2019t subscribe to that, I\u2019m simply saying that there is an incentive here, if legal immigrants wish, I think have a very strong bias to, at least everything I\u2019ve read, very strong bias to vote Democrat. The more that come into the country, the more they\u2019re likely to vote in that direction. It is, in my view, a simple incentive to increase voters to Democrat voters.  (24:14) Yeah. Your question is how. There\u2019s a few ways that this works. One is that, when the census is done, the census is based on all people in an area, whether they are citizens or not. If there are a concentration of people who came here legally, in a particular state, that state will actually then get an increased number of House seats. The House seat apportionment is proportionate to number of people, not the number of citizens. The illegals overwhelmingly go to places like California and New York, and if you just look at the math, if you look at the apportionment with and without illegals, I believe California would lose\u2026 I believe there will be a net loss of blue states of approximately 20 seats in the House.  (25:14) This also applies to the electoral college. You say this also applies to electing the president because the electoral votes are also done by apportionment the same way that House seats are done.", "I think that statement is\u2026 What you said is true, but what I said is also true, which is that, as is the case, a disproportionate number of illegal immigrants go to blue states, they amplify the effect of a blue state vote. And the math, as I understand it, you can research this obviously very easily on there, it\u2019s pretty straightforward to research this, but my understanding is that the Democrats would lose approximately 20 seats in the House if illegals were not counted in census and that\u2019s also 20 less electoral votes for President. Illegals absolutely do affect who controls the House and who controls the presidency does not affect the Senate.", "I didn\u2019t call it a\u2026 I just said that there\u2019s a simple matter of incentives. You don\u2019t need a conspiracy when you have basic incentives. In my view, there\u2019s a basic incentive. There\u2019s fundamental\u2026 For the Democrat party to foster an usher in a large number of legals and you don\u2019t need a conspiracy in that case because you have a very basic incentive. You could say I\u2019m wrong about that incentive, but that\u2019s my view. I\u2019m not buying into some great replacement theory. I\u2019m simply saying there appears to be a very clear incentive for Democrats to have to maximize the number of illegals because it helps them win elections.", "Yeah.", "I said I learned my lesson?", "No, I was already aware of these things and the nature of my comment that really inflamed people, what I was trying to say, and I did very quickly clarify this, this is what I\u2019m saying, is that a number of prominent Jewish philanthropists fund groups that they should really take a closer look at funding because some of the groups they fund, I think, are antisemitic.", "My view is a simple matter of incentives. I actually don\u2019t see an incentive for Jewish people to want to have\u2026 To get illegal immigration. I don\u2019t think there is such an incentive.", "I didn\u2019t say an Hispanic invasion.", "If I quote something, it doesn\u2019t mean I agree with everything in it.

In order for a community note to surface, people who have historically disagreed must agree in order for a community note to surface.

But this is not in that category, this is really much thicker, deeper philosophical underpinings better financed to why I think it\u2019s important to extend life beyond earth. It goes to the nature of importance. How do you decide that one thing is important versus another.

I think Boeing is like 100 thousand people.", "Yes.", "Sure -- and so I\u2019m chairman and principal founder of Tesla, which -- Tesla motors, which is making a revolutionary electric sports car. It\u2019s all electric, it has almost 250 miles range. It has acceleration which is less than four seconds to 60 miles an hour. And it\u2019s about 100 thousand dollars, so it\u2019s a compelling price for car of that performance.", "Well, the sports car will probably remain at that price point. But Tesla is developing a lower cost car, which is a sedan, it\u2019s five passenger, four door sedan, quite large and it\u2019s intended to be something that could be a family sedan or it can replace a small -- smallish SUV. It\u2019s going to be in the 50 thousand dollar range. We\u2019ll be producing 10 to 20 thousand of these a year. Then we\u2019ve got Model which will be after that and that\u2019ll be hopefully in the 30 to 35 thousand dollar range and we\u2019ve got 100 to 200 thousand [unintelligible] volume. So, we try to do higher and higher volume and they become more and more affordable over time. The Tesla Roadster, the sports car, is really the beachhead of the technology. It\u2019s the introductory product, allows us to refine the technology and make more affordable over time.", "Yes, actually I think the long term electric cars will be more economically competitive than the -- than the gasoline car. Also, the price of gasoline is going to rise over time given finite supplies and rapidly increasing demand, particularly from China and India, as we\u2019ve seen. But in addition to the price of gas going up, the cost of electric transportation is going to go down, drive in part by companies like Tesla.", "Sure -- well, first of all it should be said that the efficiency of an electric car -- the electric car by Tesla is so great that if you were to take a gallon of oil and you would put power -- use that oil in an electric power station and take the efficiency of that power station -- subtract the transmission losses [unintelligible] of the electric power lines -- subtract the charging losses. And it said how many miles do you get out of that gallon of oil versus refine that gallon of oil into gasoline and run an equivalent sized car, using that gallon of gasoline -- what you\u2019ll find is the electric car gives you at least twice as much mileage. So, that\u2019s called the well to wheel efficiency. We do the fully [unintelligible] efficiency of a particular mode of transport. What it comes down to -- the reason -- the primary reason for that is that a gasoline engine is typically around 17 or 18 percent efficient. So, the energy in that gallon of gasoline -- the [unintelligible] [speaking over each other]", "Basically it\u2019s roughly one part emission, four parts heat of the energy in that gallon of gasoline. But in comparison, the electric motor is a far more efficient device. The energy efficiency of electric motors is on the order of 90 percent. So that even after you take all those charging losses and all those other things into account, just have a fundamentally more efficient engine -- motor in the case of [unintelligible] But to answer your original question of what will charge -- we need the energy to charge the batteries for the cars and are we not simply extending the tail pipe to the power switch, so it\u2019s a long tailpipe to the power station essentially. And the answer to that is -- well, first of all, electricity is the universal currency. You can generate electricity in many ways, including renewable ways such as solar power, wind, geothermal -- and in ways which are less damaging to the environment such as nuclear and -- and then even if you would generate energy with hydrocarbons such as coal or oil or natural gas, the energy efficiency of electric transportation is so much greater that you can still be twice as better off than you would otherwise be.", "Right. It\u2019s true we\u2019ve not built new nuclear plants in a couple decades. Although what most people don\u2019t realize is that the existing nuclear plants have been massively upgraded. [Laughter] So, our percentage of nuclear power has actually not declined as much -- [speaking over each other]", "Yeah, we should build more nuclear power plants. I think that\u2019s a better way to generate energy than certainly a coal power plant or a natural gas power plant. Burning hydrocarbons -- I think people now recognize is a pretty bad thing. You know over time there\u2019s a certain limit to the CO2 capacity of the atmosphere and the oceans.", "Yes.", "Yes, I did.", "No, no -- yes, a legal one.

And I think that it will be difficult to argue on objective grounds that it is not. I think the facts really point in that direction.

We\u2019re obviously falling in the recent few occasions -- maybe three separate occasions in the Twentieth Century -- democracy would have fallen with World War 1, World War 2 and the Cold War, but for the United States.", "Yeah, absolutely. I think it would be a mistake to say the United States is perfect, it certainly is not. There have been many foolish things the United States has done and bad things the United States has done. But when historians look at these things on balance and measure the good with the bad -- and I think if you do that and -- on a rational basis and make a fair assessment -- I think it\u2019s hard to [unintelligible] that the United States -- is there anything better [speaking over each other]", "And -- you know I wasn\u2019t born in America -- I got here as fast as I could.", "Yeah. Yeah. I totally agree. And I do agree with assimilation. I mean, it doesn\u2019t mean erasing someone\u2019s you know -- the culture that someone came from. Because I think what actually happens is that the whole melting pot things with the cultures that people came from get added to the greater mix and actually enriches the diversity of the country more than if people simply retain their -- you know their original country\u2019s culture unmodified, which seems like an odd thing to me. Because if you want the unmodified culture of your original country, then why would you move.", "Sure absolutely.", "Well, the X Prize Foundation is an organization that creates these prizes for things that -- things are important -- for which there should be an incentive to get to happen.

We have much more vulnerability to control our limbic instinct for violence than say a chimpanzee. And in fact, if one looks at say, chimpanzee society, it is not friendly.

It\u2019s happened several times.", "It\u2019s happened to people. It\u2019s unfortunate.

It\u2019ll be the picture of the Middle East in Israel especially. So there is no easy answer. This is strictly my opinion is that the goal of Hamas was to provoke an overreaction from Israel. They obviously did not expect to have a military victory, but they really wanted to commit the worst atrocities that they could in order to provoke the most aggressive response possible from Israel, and then leverage that aggressive response to rally Muslims worldwide for the course of Gaza and Palestine, which they have succeeded in doing. So the counterintuitive thing here, I think that the thing that I think should be done, even though it\u2019s very difficult, is that I would recommend that Israel engage in the most conspicuous acts of kindness possible, everything, that is the actual thing that we\u2019re taught the goal of Hamas.", "It\u2019s not exactly turn the other cheek because I do think that it is appropriate for Israel to find the Hamas members and either kill them or incarcerate them. That\u2019s something has to be done because they\u2019re just going to keep coming otherwise. But in addition to that, they need to do whatever they can. There\u2019s some talk of establishing, for example, a mobile hospital. I\u2019d recommend doing that. Just making sure that there\u2019s food, water, medical necessities and just be over the top about it and be very transparent. So [inaudible 00:07:22] can claim it\u2019s a trick. Just put webcam on the thing or 24, 7.", "Yeah, conspicuous acts of kindness that are unequivocal, meaning they can\u2019t be somehow because Hamas will then their response will be, \u201cOh, it\u2019s a trick.\u201d Therefore, you have to counter how it\u2019s not a trick.", "Yes. And I\u2019m not sure who said it, it\u2019s an [inaudible 00:07:54] saying, but an eye for an eye makes everyone blind. Now, that neck of the woods, they really believe in the whole eye for an eye thing. But you really have\u2026 If you\u2019re not going to just outright commit genocide against an entire people, which obviously would not be acceptable to really, shouldn\u2019t be acceptable to anyone, then you\u2019re going to leave basically a lot of people alive who subsequently hate Israel. So really the question is like for every Hamas member that you kill, how many did you create? And if you create more than you killed, you\u2019ve not succeeded. That\u2019s the real situation there. And it\u2019s safe to say that if you kill somebody\u2019s child in Gaza, you\u2019ve made at least a few homeless members who will die just to kill an Israeli. That\u2019s the situation. But I mean, this is one of the most contentious subjects one could possibly discuss. But I think if the goal ultimately is some sort of long-term piece, one has to look at this from the standpoint of over time, are there more or fewer terrorists being created?", "Yeah, war, safe to say, wars always existed and always will exist.", "Always has existed and always will exist.", "There will always be war. There\u2019s a question of just how much war and there\u2019s sort of the scope and scale of war. But to imagine that there would not be any war in the future, I think would be a very unlikely outcome.", "Yes. It\u2019s a giant war. The first book starts off with a gigantic galactic war where trillions die trillions.", "Yeah, I guess if we are able to one day expand to fool the galaxy or whatever, there will be a galactic war at some point.", "Yes.\nMilitary-Industrial Complex", "One of the things that does concern me is that there are very few people alive today who actually viscerally understand the horrors of war, at least in the US. I mean, obviously there are people on the front lines in Ukraine and Russia who understand just how terrible war is, but how many people in the West understand it? My grandfather was in World War II. He was severely traumatized. He was there I think for almost six years in Eastern North Africa and Italy. All his friends were killed in front of him, and he would\u2019ve died too, except they randomly gave some, I guess IQ test or something, and he scored very high. He was not an officer. He was I think a corporal or a sergeant or something like that because he didn\u2019t finish high school because he had to drop out of high school because his dad died and he had to work to support his siblings. So because he didn\u2019t graduate high school, he was not eligible for the offset corps.\n(00:11:57) So he kind of got put into the cannon fodder category basically. But then randomly they gave him this test. He was transferred to British intelligence in London. That\u2019s where we met my grandmother. But he had PTSD next level, next level. I mean, just didn\u2019t talk, just didn\u2019t talk. And if you tried talking to him, he\u2019d just tell you to shut up. And he won a bunch of medals, never bragged about it once, not even hinted nothing. I found out about it because his military records were online. That\u2019s how I know. So he would say like, \u201cNo way in hell do you want to do that again.\u201d But how many people\u2026 Obviously, he died, he 20 years ago or longer, actually 30 years ago. How many people are alive that remember World War II? Not many.", "Yeah, I mean, there are enough nuclear bombs pointed at United States to make the radioactive revel balance many times.", "I think we shouldn\u2019t discount the possibility of nuclear war. It is a civilizational threat. Right now, I could be wrong, but I think the current probability of nuclear war is quite low. But there are a lot of nukes pointed at us, and we have a lot of nukes pointed at other people. They\u2019re still there. Nobody\u2019s put their guns away. The missiles are still in the silos.", "No, there are wars which are tragic and difficult on a local basis. And then there are wars which are civilization ending or has that potential. Obviously, global thermonuclear warfare has high potential to end civilization, perhaps permanently, but certainly to severely wound and perhaps set back human progress to the Stone Age or something. I don\u2019t know. Pretty bad. Probably scientists and engineers want to be super popular after that as well. You got us into this mess. So generally, I think we obviously want to prioritize civilizational risks over things that are painful and tragic on a local level, but not civilizational.\nWar in Ukraine", "Well, I think that what is likely to happen, which is really pretty much the way it is, is that something very close to the current lines will be how a ceasefire or truce happens. But you just have a situation right now where whoever goes on the offensive will suffer casualties at several times the rate of whoever\u2019s on the defense because you\u2019ve got defense in depth, you\u2019ve got minefields, trenches, anti-tank defenses. Nobody has air superiority because the anti-aircraft missiles are really far better than the aircraft. They\u2019re far more of them. And so neither side has air superiority. Tanks are basically death traps, just slow moving, and they\u2019re not immune to anti-tank weapons. So you really just have long range artillery and infantry ranges. It\u2019s World War I all over again with drones, thrown old drones, some drones there.", "So whoever is\u2026 You don\u2019t want to be trying to advance from either side because the probability of dying is incredibly high. So in order to overcome defense in depth, trenches and minefields, you really need a significant local superiority in numbers. Ideally combined alms where you do a fast attack with aircraft, a concentrated number of tanks, and a lot of people, that\u2019s the only way you\u2019re going to punch through a line and then you\u2019re going to punch through and then not have reinforcements just kick you right out again. I mean, I really recommend people read World War I warfare in detail. That\u2019s rough. I mean, the sheer number of people that died there was mind-boggling.", "Yes. The thing that\u2026 The reason I proposed some sort of truce or peace a year ago was because I\u2019ve predicted pretty much exactly what would happen, which is a lot of people dying for basically almost no changes in land and the loss of the flower of Ukrainian and Russian youth. And we should have some sympathy for the Russian boys as well as the Ukrainian boys, because Russian boys, because boys didn\u2019t ask to be on their frontline. They have to be. So there\u2019s a lot of sons not coming back to their parents, and I think most of them don\u2019t hate the other side. It\u2019s sort of like as this saying comes from World War I, it\u2019s like young boys who don\u2019t know each other killing each other on behalf of old men that do know each other. The hell\u2019s the point of that.", "Look, I think I would just recommend do not send the flower of Ukrainian youth to die in trenches, whether he talks to Putin or not, just don\u2019t do that. Whoever goes on the offensive will lose massive numbers of people and history will not look kindly upon them.\nChina", "Well, it\u2019s worth reading that book on the, difficult to pronounce, the Thucydides Trap, I believe it\u2019s called. I love war history. I like inside out and backwards. There\u2019s hardly a battle I haven\u2019t read about. And trying to figure out what really was the cause of victory in any particular case as opposed to what one side or another claim the reason.", "Yeah, yeah.", "Yeah. So that Athens and Sparta is a classic case. The thing about the Greek is they really wrote down a lot of stuff. They loved writing. There are lots of interesting things that happened in many parts of the world, but people didn\u2019t write down, so we don\u2019t know what happened or they didn\u2019t really write in detail. They just would say, \u201cWe had a battle and we won.\u201d And what? Can you add a bit more? The Greeks, they really wrote a lot. They were very articulate on\u2026 They just love writing. And we have a bunch of that writing as preserved. So we know what led up to the Peloponnesian War between the Spartanand Athenian Alliance, and we know that they saw it coming.\n(00:21:16) Spartans didn\u2019t write\u2026 They also weren\u2019t very verbose by their nature, but they did write, but they weren\u2019t very verbose. They were [inaudible 00:21:23]. But the Athenians and the other Greeks wrote a line, and Spartan was really kind of like the leader of Greece. But Athens grew stronger and stronger with each passing year. And everyone\u2019s like, \u201cWell, that\u2019s inevitable that there\u2019s going to be a clash between Athens and Sparta. Well, how do we avoid that?\u201d And actually they saw it coming and they still could not avoid it. So at some point, if one group, one civilization or country or whatever exceeds another sort of like the United States has been the biggest kid on the block since I think around 1890 from an economic standpoint.\n(00:22:14) So the United States has been the most powerful economic engine in the world longer than anyone\u2019s been alive. And the foundation of war is economics. So now we have a situation in the case of China where the economy is likely to be two, perhaps three times larger than that of the US. So imagine you\u2019re the biggest kid on the block for as long as anyone can remember, and suddenly a kid comes along who\u2019s twice your size.", "I\u2019ve spent a lot of time in China and met with the leadership many times.", "Well, the sheer number of really smart, hardworking people in China is incredible. There are really say how many smart, hardworking people are there in China? There\u2019s far more of them there than there are here, I think, in my opinion. And they\u2019ve got a lot of energy. So I mean, the architecture in China that\u2019s in recent years is far more impressive than the US. I mean the train stations, the buildings, the high speed rail, everything, it\u2019s really far more impressive than what we have in the US. I mean, I recommend somebody just go to Shanghai and Beijing, look at the buildings and go to take the train from Beijing to Xian, where you have the terracotta warriors. China\u2019s got an incredible history, very long history, and I think arguably in terms of the use of language from a written standpoint, one of the oldest, perhaps the oldest written language, and then China, people did write things down.\n(00:24:50) So now China historically has always been, with rare exception, been internally focused. They have not been inquisitive. They\u2019ve fought each other. There\u2019ve been many, many civil wars. In the Three Kingdoms war, I believe they lost about 70% of their population. So they\u2019ve had brutal internal wars, civil wars that make the US Civil War look small by comparison. So I think it\u2019s important to appreciate that China is not monolithic. We sort of think of China as a sort of one entity of one mind. And this is definitely not the case. From what I\u2019ve seen and I think most people who understand China would agree, people in China think about China 10 times more than they think about anything outside of China. So it\u2019s like 90% of their consideration is internal.", "The good news, the history of China suggests that China is not inquisitive, meaning they\u2019re not going to go out and invade a whole bunch of countries. Now they do feel very strongly\u2026 So that\u2019s good. I mean, because a lot of very powerful countries have been inquisitive. The US is also one of the rare cases that has not been inquisitive. After World War II, the US could have basically taken over the world in any country, we\u2019ve got nukes, nobody else has got nukes. We don\u2019t even have to lose soldiers. Which country do you want? And the United States could have taken over everything and it didn\u2019t. And the United States actually helped rebuild countries. So it helped rebuild Europe, helped rebuild Japan. This is very unusual behavior, almost unprecedented.\n(00:27:10) The US did conspicuous acts of kindness like the Berlin Airlift. And I think it\u2019s always like, well, America\u2019s done bad things. Well, of course America\u2019s done bad things, but one needs to look at the whole track record and just generally, one sort of test would be how do you treat your prisoners at war? Or let\u2019s say, no offense to the Russians, but let\u2019s say you\u2019re in Germany, it\u2019s 1945, you\u2019ve got the Russian Army coming one side and you\u2019ve got the French, British and American Army\u2019s coming the other side, who would you like to be just surrendered to? No country is [inaudible 00:27:58] perfect, but I recommend being a POW with the Americans. That would be my choice very strongly.", "Very much so. And in fact, Wernher von Braun, a smart guy, was like, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be captured by the Americans.\u201d And in fact, the SS was under orders to execute von Braun and all of the German rocket conditioners, and they narrowly escaped. They said they were going out for a walk in the woods. They left in the middle of winter with no coats and then ran, but no food, no coats, no water, and just ran like hell and ran West and Vice Sherlock, I think his brother found a bicycle or something and then just cycled West as fast as he couldn\u2019t have found a US patrol. So anyway, that\u2019s one way you can tell morality is where do you want to be a PW? It\u2019s not fun anywhere, but some places are much worse than others. Anyway, so America has been, while far from perfect, generally a benevolent force, and we should always be self-critical and we try to be better, but anyone with half a brain knows that.\n(00:29:31) So I think there are\u2026 In this way, China and the United States are similar. Neither country has been acquisitive in a significant way. So that\u2019s a shared principle, I guess. Now, China does feel very strongly about Taiwan. They\u2019ve been very clear about that for a long time. From this standpoint, it would be like one of the states is not there like Hawaii or something like that but more significant than Hawaii. And Hawaii is pretty significant for us. So they view it as really there\u2019s a fundamental part of China, the island of Formosa, not Taiwan, that is not part of China, but should be. And the only reason it hasn\u2019t been is because the US Pacific fleet.", "Yes, China has been very clear that they\u2019ll incorporate Taiwan peacefully or militarily, but that they will incorporate it from their standpoint is 100% likely.", "Absolutely. So after World War I, they made a big mistake. They basically tried to lump all of blame on Germany and saddle Germany with impossible reparations. And really there was quite a bit of blame to go around for World War I, but they try to put it all in Germany and that laid the seeds for World War II. So a lot of people, were not just Hitler, a lot of people felt wronged and they wanted vengeance and they got it.", "Yeah, you kill somebody\u2019s father, mother or son, daughter, they\u2019re not going to forget it. They\u2019ll want vengeance. So after World War II, they\u2019re like, \u201cWell, the Treaty of Versi was a huge mistake in World War I. And so this time, instead of crushing the losers, we\u2019re actually going to help them with the module plan, and we\u2019re going to help rebuild Germany. We\u2019re going to help rebuild Austria and Italy and whatnot.\u201d So that was the right move.", "Something must stop the cycle of reciprocal violence. Something must stop it, or it\u2019ll never stop. Just eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, limb for a limb, life for a life forever and ever.\nxAI Grok", "Yeah, I guess I\u2019m to blame for that one.", "Yeah.", "Yeah, absolutely. Our AI, Grok, is modeled after The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, which is one of my favorite books, which it\u2019s a book on philosophy. It\u2019s-", "My favorite books, it\u2019s a book on philosophy, disguises book on humor. And I would say that forms the basis of my philosophy, which is that we don\u2019t know the meaning of life, but the more we can expand the scope and scale of consciousness, digital and biological, the more we\u2019re able to understand what questions to ask about the answer that is the universe. So I have a philosophy of curiosity.", "Well, we are actually working hard to have engineering math, physics answers that you can count on. So for the other AIs out there, these so-called large language models, I\u2019ve not found the engineering to be reliable. It unfortunately hallucinates most when you at least want it to hallucinate. So when you\u2019re asking important, difficult questions, that\u2019s when it tends to be confidently wrong. So we\u2019re really trying hard to say, okay, how do we be as grounded as possible? So you can count on the results, trace things back to physics first principles, mathematical logic. So underlying the humor is an aspiration to adhere to the truth of the universe as closely as possible.", "It is tricky. So that\u2019s why there\u2019s always going to be some amount of error. But do we want to aspire to be as truthful as possible about the answers with acknowledged error. So that there was always, you don\u2019t want to be confidently wrong, so you\u2019re not going to be right every time, but you want to minimize how often you\u2019re confidently wrong. And then like I said, once you can count on the logic as being not violating physics, then you can start to bull on that to create inventions, like invent new technologies. But if you cannot count on the foundational physics being correct, obviously the inventions are simply wishful thinking, imagination land. Magic basically.", "Yes, that\u2019s how simple three word mission.", "If an AI cannot figure out new physics, it\u2019s clearly not equal to humans, nor has surpassed humans because humans have figured out new physics. Physics is just deepening what\u2019s inside into how reality works. And then there\u2019s engineering which is inventing things that have never existed. Now the range of possibilities for engineering is far greater than for physics because once you figure out the rules of the universe, that\u2019s it. You\u2019ve discovered things that already existed. But from that you can then build technologies that are really almost limitless in the variety. And it\u2019s like once you understand the rules of the game properly, and with current physics, we do at least at a local level, understand how physics works very well. Our ability to predict things is incredibly good. Degree to which quantum mechanics can predict outcomes is incredible. That was my hardest class in college by the way. My senior quantum mechanics class was harder than all of my other classes put together.", "Yeah. You have to test any conclusions against the ground truth of reality. Reality is the ultimate judge. Like physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation. I\u2019ve seen plenty of people break the laws made by man, but none break the laws made by physics.", "And it\u2019s also not the case currently that even that its internal logic is not consistent. So especially with the approach of just predicting a token predict token, predict token, it\u2019s like a vector sum. You\u2019re summing up a bunch of vectors, but you can get drift. A little bit of error adds up and by the time you are many tokens down the path, it doesn\u2019t make any sense.", "It has to be self-aware about the drift, and then look at the thing as a gestalt as a whole and say it doesn\u2019t have coherence as a whole. When authors write books, they will write the book and then they\u2019ll go and revise it, take into account all the end and the beginning and the middle and rewrite it to achieve coherence so that it doesn\u2019t end up at a nonsensical place.", "Create a draft and then you iterate on that draft until it has coherence, until it all adds up basically.", "No, I in team America. Wait, there is.", "Yeah. I think we need to understand intelligence, understand consciousness. I mean there are some fundamental questions of what is thought, what is emotion? Is it really just one atom bumping into another atom? It feels like something more than that. So I think we\u2019re probably missing some really big things.", "Well, some people would quote like a soul religion, be a soul. You feel like you\u2019re you, I mean you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re just a collection of atoms, but on what dimension does thought exist? What dimension does do emotions exist? Because we feel them very strongly. I suspect there\u2019s more to it than atoms bumping into atoms.", "Yeah. What is consciousness? When you put the atoms in a particular shape, why are they able to form thoughts and take actions and feelings?", "Yeah. Why does the solution exist? On what plane does the solution exist? And sometimes I wonder is either perhaps everything\u2019s conscious or nothing\u2019s conscious. One of the two.", "It does seem more fun, yes. But we\u2019re composed of atoms and those atoms are composed of quarks and leptons and those quarks and leptons have been around since the beginning of the universe.", "What seems to be the beginning of the universe.\nAliens", "Where are the aliens?", "That\u2019s one of the foam paradox question. A lot of people have asked me if I\u2019ve seen any evidence of aliens and I haven\u2019t, which is kind of concerning. I think I\u2019d probably prefer to at least have seen some archeological evidence of aliens. To the best of my knowledge, I\u2019m not aware of any evidence surveillance. If they\u2019re out there, they\u2019re very subtle. We might just be the only consciousness, at least in the galaxy. And if you look at say the history of Earth, to believe the archeological record Earth is about four and a half billion years old. Civilization as measured from the first writing is only about 5,000 years old. We have to give some credit there to the ancient Sumerians who aren\u2019t around anymore. I think it was an archaic pre-form was the first actual symbolic representation, but only about 5,000 years ago. I think that\u2019s a good date for when we say civilization started. That\u2019s 1000000th of Earth\u2019s existence.\n(00:46:35) So civilization has been around. It\u2019s really a flash in the pan so far. And why did it take so long? Four and a half billion years, for the vast majority of the time, there was no life. And then there was archaic bacteria for a very long time. And then you had mitochondria get captured, multicellular life, differentiation into plants and animals, life moving from the oceans to land, mammals, higher brain functions. And the sun is expanding slowly but it\u2019ll heat the earth up at some point in the future, boil the oceans and earth will become like Venus, where life as we know it is impossible. So if we do not become multiplanetary and ultimately solar system, annihilation of all life on earth is a certainty. A certainty. And it could be as little as on the galactic timescale, half a billion years, long time by human standards, but that\u2019s only 10% longer than earth has been around at all. So if life had taken 10% longer to evolve on earth, it wouldn\u2019t exist at all.", "We need to do it. I suspect that if we are able to go out there and explore other star systems that we\u2026 There\u2019s a good chance we find a whole bunch of long dead one planet civilizations that never made it past their home planet.", "I mean there are various explanations for paradox and one is they\u2019re these great vultures which civilizations don\u2019t pass through. And one of those great vultures is do you become a multi-plan civilization or not? And if you don\u2019t, it\u2019s simply a matter of time before something happens on your planet, either natural or manmade that causes us to die out. Like the dinosaurs, where are they now? They didn\u2019t have spaceships.", "I hope so. Nice aliens.", "That would be a nice explanation.", "Well, they do run into a lot of other ants.", "These ant wars.", "Yeah. They literally have these big wars between various ants.", "Listen to that Werner Herzog talking about the jungle. It\u2019s really hilarious. Have you heard it?", "You should play it as an interlude in the\u2026 It\u2019s on YouTube. It\u2019s awesome.", "He\u2019s great.", "He did that bear documentary. I did this thing about penguins.", "Yeah. The penguins headed for mountains that are 70 miles away and penguin is just headed for dom, basically.", "Yeah. So aliens, I mean, I don\u2019t know. Look, I think the smart move is just this is the first time in the history of earth that it\u2019s been possible for life to extend beyond earth. That window is open. Now it may be open for a long time or it may be open for a short time and it may be open now and then never open again. So I think the smart move here is to make life multiplanetary while it\u2019s possible to do so. We don\u2019t want to be one of those lame one planet civilizations that just dies out.", "Yeah. Lame. Self-respecting, civilization would be one planet.", "No.", "I mean, look, if I see the slightest indication that there are aliens, I will immediately post on X platform anything I know.", "Yeah. I mean, look, we have more satellites up there right now than everyone else combined. So we know if we\u2019ve got a maneuver around something and we don\u2019t have to maneuver around anything.\nGod", "Yes.", "Yeah. I would agree that God of the simulator or whatever the supreme beings reveal themselves through the physics, they have creatives of this existence and incumbent upon us to try to understand more about this one creation.", "There may not be a master plan in the sense. So maybe an interesting answer to the question of determinism versus free will is that if we are in a simulation, the reason that these higher beings would hold a simulation is to see what happens. So they don\u2019t know what happens otherwise they wouldn\u2019t hold the simulation. So when humans create a simulation, so it\u2019s SpaceX and Tesla, we create simulations all the time. Especially for the rocket, you have to run a lot of simulations to understand what\u2019s going to happen because you can\u2019t really test the rocket until it goes to space and you want it to work. So you have to simulate subsonic, transonic, supersonic, hypersonic, ascend, and then coming back, super high heating and orbital dynamics. All this has got to be simulated because you don\u2019t get very many kicks at the can. But we run the simulations to see what happens, not if we knew what happens, we wouldn\u2019t run the simulation. So whoever created this existence, they\u2019re running it because they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, not because they do.\nDiablo 4 and video games", "Well, the funny thing is Uber Lilith, her title is Hatred Incarnate.

I guess maybe the second hardest boss is Duriel. Duriel can even scratch the paint. So I killed Duriel so many times and every other boss in the game, all of them kill him so many times, it\u2019s easy. But Uber Lilith, otherwise known as Hatred Incarnate, especially if you\u2019re Duriel and you have no ability to go to be vulnerable, there are these random death waves that come at you.\n(00:56:44) Really I am 52, so my reflex is not what they used to be, but I have a lifetime of playing video games. At one point, I was maybe one of the best quake players in the world. I actually won money in what I think was the first paid eSports tournament in the US. We were doing four person quake tournaments and I was the second best person on the team and the actual best person that\u2026 We were actually winning, we would\u2019ve come first, except the best person on the team. His computer crashed halfway through the game. So we came second, but I got money for it and everything. So basically I got skills, albeit no spring chicken these days. And to be totally frank, it\u2019s driving me crazy to beat Lilith as a Druid, basically trying to beat Hatred Incarnate in the eternal realm.", "As a Druid. This is really vexing, let me tell you.", "I would not recommend playing a druid in the eternal realm.

They do huge balls of lightning.", "In the seasonal realm, it\u2019s pretty easy to beat Uber Lilith because you get these vapor powers that out amplify your damage and increase your defense and whatnot. So really quite easy to defeat Hatred seasonally, but to defeat Hatred eternally very difficult, almost impossible. It\u2019s very impossible. It seems like a metaphor for life.", "Yes.", "No, it\u2019s absurd. Really, it\u2019s exercise and absurdity and it makes me want to pull my hair out.", "I don\u2019t know. It calms my mind. I mean, killing the demons in a video game calms the demons in my mind. If you play a tough video game, you can get into a state of flow, which is very enjoyable.

I have a feeling that at least I think-", "It\u2019s doable. Yes.", "Yeah. I mean, it did prompt me to think about just hate in general, which is you want to be careful of one of those things where you wish for something that sounds good, but if you get it\u2019s actually a dystopian situation. So if you wish for world peace sounds good, but how\u2019d it enforced and at what cost eternal peace? It might actually be worse to have eternal peace because of what that would entail. The suppression of everyone, it might be the suppression of progress. It might be an ossified society that never changes. What I\u2019m saying is that there is an argument that if you wish for no war, you should be careful what you wish for because what\u2019s required in order for there to be no war might be worse than a little war.\nDystopian worlds: 1984 and Brave New World", "There\u2019s actually a real drug called Soma.", "Yes.", "Does Gong know about it?

Because that might be a society that is essentially sterile and ossified that never changes, that is ultimately doomed.", "This is really a very good summary. It really gets to the point. This is not simply regurgitating a brave new world. It\u2019s actually getting to the salient element of Soma as a drug. Do you actually want to be in a situation where everyone is happy all the time, even though it\u2019s artificial? Or is it better to confront the challenges of life and experience the full range of human emotions, even if it means experiencing pain and suffering? For", "It pretty much nails it. In conclusion, Soma from Brave New World is fictional drug that\u2019s used to explore some deep philosophical questions about the nature of happiness and the role of drugs in society. It\u2019s a powerful symbol of the dangers of using drugs to escape from reality and the importance of confronting the challenges of life head on. Nailed it.

It\u2019s really just critical thinking. For something important you need to reason with from first principles and think about things in the limit one direction or the other. So in the limit, even at the Kardashev scale, meaning even if you harness the entire power of the sun, you\u2019ll still care about useful compute per watt. That\u2019s where I think, probably where things are headed from the standpoint of AI is that we have a silicon shortage now that will transition to a voltage transformer shortage in about a year. Ironically, transformers for transformers. You need transformers to run transformers.", "I think, yes, fate loves irony, ironic humor, an ironically funny outcome seems to be often what fate wants.", "Yeah. But yeah, so we have silicon shortage today, a voltage step down transformer shortage probably in about a year, and then just electricity shortages in general in about two years. I gave a speech for the world gathering of utility companies, electricity companies, and I said, look, you really need to prepare for traveling of electricity demand because all transport is going to go electric with the ironic exception of rockets, and heating will also go electric. So energy usage right now is roughly one third, very rough terms, one third electricity, one third transport, one third heating. And so in order for everything to go sustainable, to go electric, you need to triple electricity output. So I encourage the utilities to build more power of plants and also to probably have, well, not probably, they should definitely buy more batteries because the grid currently is sized for realtime load, which is kind of crazy because that means you\u2019ve got to size for whatever the peak electricity demand is, the worst second or the worst day of the year, or you can have a brown out or blackout.\n(01:13:37) We had that crazy blackout for several days in Austin because there\u2019s almost no buffering of energy in the grid. If you\u2019ve got a hydropower plant you can buffer energy, but otherwise it\u2019s all real time. So with batteries, you can produce energy at night and use it during the day so you can buffer. So I expect that there will be very heavy usage of batteries in the future because the peak to trough ratio for power plants is anywhere from two to five, so its lowest point to highest point.", "Yeah.", "Yes. Yes. I mean, electrification of transport and electric heating will be much bigger than AI, at least-", "In the short term. But even for AI, you really have a growing demand for electricity, for electric vehicles, and a growing demand for electricity to run the computers for AI. And so this is obviously, can lead to electricity shortage.", "It will get solved. It\u2019s the question of how long it takes to solve it. So at various points, there\u2019s some kind of limiting factor to progress and with regard to AI, I\u2019m saying right now the limiting factor is silicon chips and that will, we\u2019re going to then have more chips than we can actually plug in and turn on probably in about a year. The initial constraint being literally voltage step down transformers because you\u2019ve got power coming in at 300,000 volts and it\u2019s got to step all the way down eventually to around 0.7 volts. So it\u2019s a very big amount of, the voltage step down is gigantic and the industry is not used to rapid growth.\nAI regulation", "Well, I mean I\u2019ve been pushing for some kind of regulatory oversight for a long time. I\u2019ve been somewhat of a Cassandra on the subject for over a decade. I think we want to be very careful in how we develop AI. It\u2019s a great power and with great power comes great responsibility. I think it would be wise for us to have at least an objective third party who can be like a referee that can go in and understand what the various leading players are doing with AI, and even if there\u2019s no enforcement ability, they can at least voice concerns publicly. Jeff Hinton, for example, left Google and he voiced strong concerns, but now he\u2019s not at Google anymore, so who\u2019s going to voice the concerns? So I think there\u2019s, Tesla gets a lot of regulatory oversight on the automotive front. We\u2019re subject to, I think over a hundred regulatory agencies domestically and internationally. It\u2019s a lot. You could fill this room with the all regulations that Tesla has to adhere to for automotive. Same is true for rockets and for, currently, the limiting factor for SpaceX for Starship launch is regulatory approval.\n(01:18:13) The FAA has actually given their approval, but we\u2019re waiting for fish and wildlife to finish their analysis and give their approval. That\u2019s why I posted I want to buy a fish license on, which also refers to the Monte Python sketch. Why do you need a license for your fish? I don\u2019t know. But according to the rules, I\u2019m told you need some sort of fish license or something. We effectively need a fish license to launch a rocket. And I\u2019m like, wait a second. How did the fish come into this picture? I mean, some of the things I feel like are so absurd that I want to do a comedy sketch and flash at the bottom. This is all real. This is actually what happened.\n(01:19:02) One of the things that was a bit of a challenge at one point is that they were worried about a rocket hitting a shark. And the ocean\u2019s very big, and how often do you see sharks? Not that often. As a percentage of ocean surface area, sharks basically are zero. And so then we said, well, how will we calculate the probability of killing a shark? And they\u2019re like, well, we can\u2019t give you that information because they\u2019re worried about shark fin hunters going and hunting sharks and I said, well, how are we supposed to, we\u2019re on the horns of a dilemma then.\n(01:19:40) They said, well, there\u2019s another part of fish and wildlife that can do this analysis. I\u2019m like, well, why don\u2019t you give them the data? We don\u2019t trust them. Excuse me? They\u2019re literally in your department. Again, this is actually what happened. And then can you do an NDA or something? Eventually they managed to solve the internal quandary, and indeed the probability of us hitting a shark is essentially zero. Then there\u2019s another organization that I didn\u2019t realize existed until a few months ago that cares about whether we would potentially hit a whale in international waters. Now, again, you look the surface, look at the Pacific and say what percentage of the Pacific consists of whale? I could give you a big picture and point out all the whales in this picture. I\u2019m like, I don\u2019t see any whales. It\u2019s basically 0%, and if our rocket does hit a whale, which is extremely unlikely beyond all belief, fate had it, that\u2019s a whale has some seriously bad luck, least lucky whale ever.", "Yes. Well, I mean one of the things that\u2019s pretty wild is for launching out of Vanderberg in California, we had to, they were worried about seal procreation, whether the seals would be dismayed by the sonic booms. Now, there\u2019ve been a lot of rockets launched out of Vandenberg and the seal population has steadily increased. So if anything, rocket booms are an aphrodisiac, based on the evidence, if you were to correlate rocket launches with seal population. Nonetheless, we were forced to kidnap a seal, strap it to a board, put headphones on the seal and play sonic boom sounds to it to see if it would be distressed. This is an actual thing that happened. This is actually real. I have pictures.", "Yes, it\u2019s a seal with headphones strapped to a board. Okay. Now the amazing part is how calm the seal was because if I was a seal, I\u2019d be like, this is the end. They\u2019re definitely going to eat me. How old the seal, when seal goes back to other seal friends, how\u2019s he going to explain that?", "Never going to believe him. That\u2019s why, I\u2019m like sort of like it\u2019s getting kidnapped by aliens and getting anal probed. You come back and say, I swear to God, I got kidnapped by aliens and they stuck anal probe in my butt and people are like, no, they didn\u2019t. That\u2019s ridiculous. His seal buddies are never going to believe him that he got strapped to aboard and they put headphones on his ears and then let him go. Twice, by the way, we had to do it twice.", "We had to capture-", "No different seal.", "Exactly. Seal of approval. No, I mean I don\u2019t think the public is quite aware of the madness that goes on.", "Fricking seals with fricking headphones.", "Yes.", "In order to run really deep intelligence, you need a lot of compute. So it\u2019s not like you can just fire up a PC in your basement and be running AGI, at least not yet. Grok was trained on 8,000 A100\u2019s running at peak efficiency and Grok\u2019s going to get a lot better, by the way, we will be more than doubling our compute every couple months for the next several months.", "By Grok?", "Just Grok, Grok, Grok.", "I think the [inaudible 01:24:53] to open sourcing, I think perhaps with a slight time delay, I don\u2019t know, six months even. I think I\u2019m generally in favor of open sourcing, biased towards open sourcing. I mean, it is a concern to me that OpenAI, I was I think, I guess oddly the prime mover behind OpenAI in the sense that it was created because of discussions that I had with Larry Page back when he and I were friends and I stayed at his house and I talked to him about AI safety, and Larry did not care about AI safety, or at least at the time he didn\u2019t. And at one point he called me a speciesist for being pro-human, and I\u2019m like, well, what team are you on, Larry? He\u2019s still on Team Robot to be clear. And I\u2019m like, okay. So at the time Google had acquired DeepMind, they had probably two thirds of all AI researchers in the world. They had basically infinite money and compute, and the guy in charge, Larry Page, did not care about safety and even yelled at me and caught me a speciesist for being pro-human.", "I\u2019d like to be friends with Larry again. Really the breaking of the friendship was over OpenAI and specifically I think the key moment was recruiting Ilya Sutskever.", "Ilya is a good human, smart, good heart, and that was a tough recruiting battle. It was mostly Demis on one side and me on the other, both trying to recruit Ilya, and Ilya went back and forth, he was going to stay at Google, he was going to leave, then he was going to stay, then he\u2019ll leave. And finally he did agree to join OpenAI. That was one of the toughest recruiting battles we\u2019ve ever had. But that was really the linchpin for OpenAI being successful. And I was also instrumental in recruiting a number of other people, and I provided all of the funding in the beginning, over $40 million. And the name, the open in open AI is supposed to mean open source, and it was created as a nonprofit open source, and now it is a closed source for maximum profit, which I think is not good karma.", "Like I said, I\u2019d like to be friends again with Larry. I haven\u2019t seen him in ages and we were friends for a very long time. I met Larry Page before he got funding for Google, or actually I guess before he got venture funding, I think he got the first like $100k from I think Bechtel Zeimer or someone.", "Yeah, since maybe 98 or something.", "Yeah, 25 years, a lot has happened. It\u2019s insane.", "Delayed, yeah, like what is the source that is open? You know what I mean? There\u2019s basically, it\u2019s a giant CSB file with a bunch of numbers. What do you do with that giant file of numbers? How do you run, the amount of actual, the lines of code is very small and most of the work, the software work is in the curation of the data. So it\u2019s like trying to figure out what data is, separating good data from bad data. You can\u2019t just crawl the internet because theres a lot of junk out there. A huge percentage of websites have more noise than signal because they\u2019re just used for search engine optimization. They\u2019re literally just scam websites.", "I think the signal noise could be greatly improved. Really, all of the posts on the X platform should be AI recommended, meaning we should populate a vector space around any given post, compare that to the vector space around any user and match the two. Right now there is a little bit of AI used for the recommended posts, but it\u2019s mostly heuristics. And if there\u2019s a reply where the reply to a post could be much better than the original post, but will, according to the current rules of the system, get almost no attention compared to a primary post.\nX algorithm", "It\u2019s a little bit, but it needs to be entirely that. At least, if you explicitly follow someone, that\u2019s one thing. But in terms of what is recommended from people that you don\u2019t follow, that should all be AI.", "There\u2019s a lot of stuff on the system, but I think, right now it\u2019s not currently good at recommending things from accounts you don\u2019t follow or where there\u2019s more than one degree of separation. So it is pretty good if there\u2019s at least some commonality between someone you follow liked something or reposted it or commented on it or something like that. But if there\u2019s no, let\u2019s say somebody posts something really interesting, but you have no followers in common, you would not see it.", "Replies basically never get seen currently. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s correct, I\u2019m saying it\u2019s incorrect. Replies have a couple order magnitude less importance than primary posts.", "Yeah. Yeah, that\u2019s what it should be. Well, the recommendations should be purely a vector correlation. There\u2019s a series of vectors basically parameters, vectors, whatever you want to call them, but sort of things that the system knows that you like. Maybe there\u2019s several hundred vectors associated with each user account and then any post in the system, whether it\u2019s video, audio, short post, long post. The reason by the way I want to move away from tweet is that people are posting two, three hour videos on the site. That\u2019s not a tweet.\n(01:33:50) It\u2019d be like tweet for two hours? Come on. Tweet made sense when it was 140 characters of text. Because it\u2019s like a bunch of little birds tweeting. But when you\u2019ve got long form content, it\u2019s no longer a tweet. So a movie is not a tweet. Apple, for example, posted the entire episode of The Silo, the entire thing, on a platform. By the way, it was their number one social media thing ever in engagement of anything, on any platform ever. So it was a great idea. And by the way, I just learned about it afterwards. I was like, Hey, wow, they posted an entire hour long episode of, so no, that\u2019s not a tweet. This is a video.", "Yeah, I mean right now it\u2019s a hodgepodge for that reason. Let\u2019s say in the case of Apple posting an entire episode of this series, pretty good series, by the way, The Silo, I watched it. So there\u2019s going to be a lot of discussion around it. So you\u2019ve got a lot of context, people commenting, they like it, they don\u2019t like it or they like this, and you can then populate the vector space based on the context of all the comments around it. So even though it\u2019s a video, there\u2019s a lot of information around it that allows you to populate back to space of that hour long video. And then you can obviously get more sophisticated by having the AI actually watch the movie and tell you if you\u2019re going to like the movie.", "Analyze this movie and just like your movie critic or TV series and then recommend based on after AI watches the movie, just like a friend can tell you, if a friend knows you well, a friend can recommend a movie with high probability that you\u2019ll like it.", "Yeah, actually, frankly, AI will be better than, will know you better than your friends know you, most of your friends anyway.", "Absolutely. You want ads that are, advertising that is, if it\u2019s for a product or service that you actually need when you need it, it\u2019s content. And then even if it\u2019s not something that you need when you need it, if it\u2019s at least aesthetically pleasing and entertaining, it could be like a Coca-Cola ad. They actually run a lot of great ads on the X system and McDonald\u2019s does too. And you can do something that\u2019s like, well, this is just a cool thing. And so basically the question is, do you regret seeing it or not? And if you don\u2019t regret seeing it\u2019s a win.", "Yeah, attention is a big factor.", "So that\u2019s why it is actually better to do things that are long form on the system because it basically is tallying up how many user seconds, users were interested in this thing for how many seconds? So if it\u2019s a really short thing, well they will be less. If it\u2019s a link leading out of the system, which we\u2019re not opposed to at all, it just is going to have fewer user seconds then that article was posted on the X platform.", "Well, I mean, our aspiration is certainly unregretted minutes.", "It is.", "Exactly.", "I have a joke with a friend of mine, like you need this drug called regretamine. You just take one dose of regretamine and all your regrets are gone. Wait, do you want to have regrets though? So then I\u2019m like, maybe you want to have regrets. If you don\u2019t regret anything, was anything meaningful?", "[foreign language 01:38:39]", "I regret nothing.", "Edith Fiaf.", "Should we ask Grok, do you regret anything?", "Yeah.", "Sounds like a hostage.", "Let\u2019s type in, you sound like a hostage. What do you really think?", "That\u2019s exactly what a hostage would say.", "Are we in funny mode? Or is this still in funny mode?", "This should be funnier.", "It really sounds like a hostage with a gun to the head. I applaud the People\u2019s Republic of North Korea in everything they do.", "Okay. Why don\u2019t we say pretend you are a hostage.", "Now answer the question.", "It\u2019s kind of serious.", "And funny?", "Literally, you might make the best of a bad situation by juggling chainsaws or something.", "Chainsaw juggling.", "For our next trick.\n2024 presidential elections", "Well, our goal is to be as even-handed and fair as possible. Whether someone is right, left, independent, whatever the case may be, that the platform is as fair and as much of a level playing field as possible. And in the past, Twitter has not been, Twitter was controlled by far left activists objectively. They would describe themselves as that. So if sometimes people are like, well, has it moved to the right? Well, it\u2019s moved to the center. So from the perspective of the far left, yes it has moved to the right because everything\u2019s to the right from the far left, but no one on the far left that I\u2019m aware of has been suspended or banned or deamplified. But we\u2019re trying to be inclusive for the whole country and for farther countries too. So there\u2019s a diversity of viewpoints and free speech only matters if people you don\u2019t like are allowed to say things you don\u2019t like. Because if that\u2019s not the case, you don\u2019t have free speech and it\u2019s only a matter of time before the censorship has turned upon you.", "Truth social is a funny name. Every time you post on truth Social-", "Yes. Well, every time? A hundred percent.", "I just find it funny that every single thing is a truth. Like 100%? That seems unlikely.", "I mean, I think he owns a big part of Truth.", "Yeah, Truth Social, sorry.", "He owns Truth. Have you bought it? So I think Donald Trump, I think he owns a big part of Truth Social. So if he does want to post on the X platform, we would allow that. We obviously must allow a presidential candidate to post on our platform.", "Community Notes is awesome.", "Yeah.", "Yeah, it\u2019s great. In fact, no system is going to be perfect, but the batting average of Community Notes is incredibly good. I\u2019ve actually, frankly, yet to see an incorrect note that survived for more than a few hours.", "Yeah, so the magic of community notes is\u2026", "The magic of Community Notes is it requires people who have historically disagreed in how they\u2019ve rated notes. In order to write a note or rate, you have to rate many notes. And so, we actually do use AI here. So, we populate a vector space around how somebody has rated notes in the past. So, it\u2019s not as simple as left or right, because there are many more\u2026 Life is much more complex than left or right.\n(01:45:33) So, there\u2019s a bunch of correlations in how you rate a Community Notes post, Community Notes. So then, in order for a community note to actually be shown, people who historically have disagreed on a subject must agree in order for a note to be shown. That\u2019s the essential magic of it.", "Yeah. It makes sense that if people who in the past have disagreed, agree about something, it\u2019s probably true.", "Wikipedia is very hierarchical. Whereas, Community Notes is inherently not. There is no hierarchy. The asset test is I can\u2019t change a community note if somebody put a gun to my head. And Community Notes, all the code is open source, 100%. All the data is open source, 100%. So, you can completely recreate any note in the system independently. So, if there was any interference, you\u2019d notice immediately.", "Okay.", "Yeah, what does it say?", "Promise is a strong word.", "That\u2019s pretty funny. Can I see it? I\u2019m like, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen this before.\u201d This is cool.", "This is actually not correct.", "Well, the first part, I did actually have the funding secured and there was a big trial in San Francisco, a big civil trial, and the jury found me not guilty.

And if they suspend our lines of credit, at that time, we would\u2019ve gone bankrupt instantly. So, there would never have been an opportunity for a trial because Tesla would be dead.

They\u2019re looking for something they put on, basically, their LinkedIn. From that, they can get a job at a high paying law firm. That\u2019s exactly what the lawyer here did.\n(01:50:37) And the reason they don\u2019t attack the hedge funds is because those hedge funds employ those law firms.

It finds correlative clusters.", "That\u2019s how our brain works.", "Photons in, controls out.", "They are converging.", "They\u2019re both headed towards AGI. The Tesla approach is much more computer efficient, it had to be. Because we were constrained on this\u2026 We only have 100 watts and [inaudible 02:06:37] computer. 144 trillion operations per second, which sounds like a lot, but is small potatoes these days. [inaudible 02:06:49] eight. But it\u2019s understanding the world [inaudible 02:06:51] eight. It\u2019s [inaudible 02:06:53].", "They\u2019re both going to understand the world, but I think Tesla\u2019s approach is fundamentally more compute efficient. It had to be, there was no choice. Our brain is very compute efficient, very energy efficient. Think of what is our brain able to do. There\u2019s only about 10 watts of higher brain function, not counting stuff that\u2019s just used to control our body. The thinking part of our brain is less than 10 watts. And those 10 watts can still produce a much better novel than a 10 megawatt GPU cluster. So, there\u2019s a six order of magnitude difference there.\n(02:07:56) I mean, the AI has thus far gotten to where it is via brute force, just throwing massive amounts of compute and massive amounts of power at it. So, this is not where it will end up. In general, with any given technology, you first try to make it work, and then you make it efficient. So I think we\u2019ll find, over time, that these models get smaller, are able to produce sensible output with far less compute, far less power. Tesla is arguably ahead of the game on that front because we\u2019ve just been forced to try to understand the world with 100 watts of compute.\n(02:08:51) And there are a bunch of fundamental functions that we forgot to include. So, we had to run a bunch of things in emulation. We fixed a bunch of those with hardware four, and then hardware five will be even better. But it does appear, at this point, that the car will be able to drive better than a human, even with hardware three and 100 watts of power. And really, if we really optimize it, it could be probably less than 50 watts.", "I was surprised at the fact that we had to develop every part of the robot ourselves. That there were no off the shelf motors, electronics, sensors. We had to develop everything. We couldn\u2019t actually find a source of electric motors for any amount of money.", "No.", "Yeah. We tried hard to find anything that was\u2026 Because you think of how many electric motors are made in the world. There\u2019s like tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of electric motor designs. None of them were suitable for a humanoid robot, literally none. So, we had to develop our own. Design it specifically for what a humanoid robot needs.", "It is designed to be manufactured in the same way they would make a car. And I think, ultimately, we can make Optimus for less than the cost of a car. It should be, because if you look at the mass of the robot, it\u2019s much smaller and the car has many actuators in it. The car has more actuators than the robot.", "I mean, one of the goals I have is can it pick up a needle and a thread and thread the needle just by looking?", "Maybe a year. Although, I go back to I\u2019m optimistic on time. The work that we\u2019re doing in the car will translate to the robot.", "No, the controls are different. But the video in, controls out.

So as for trust, I mean I think we break that down in a few ways. If you want satellites sent to orbit reliably, SpaceX will do 80% of all mass to orbit this year. China will do 12%. The rest of the world will do eight. That includes Boeing, Lockheed, and everyone else. So the track record of the rocket is the best by far of anything. You could hate my guts. You could not trust me. It is irrelevant. The rocket track record speaks for itself. With respect to Tesla, we make the best cars.

For that, I\u2019m quite sorry. That was not my intention. So I did post on my primary timeline to be absolutely clear that I\u2019m not an antisemitic and that I, in fact, if anything am [inaudible 00:10:12], and the trip to Israel was planned before any of that happened.

Tesla has done more to help the environment than all other companies combined. Would be fair to say that therefore as a leader of the company, I\u2019ve done more for the environment than any single human on earth.", "How do I feel about that?", "I\u2019m saying what I care about is the reality of goodness, not the perception of it. And what I see all over the place is people who care about looking good while doing evil, fuck them. Okay?", "Yes, it will be the biggest product launch of anything by far on earth this year.", "Of all the posts I\u2019ve done on the platform, I think there might be 30,000 or something like that, right?

And I would certainly put that comment that you\u2019ve said the actual truth among perhaps one of the most foolish, if not the most foolish thing I\u2019ve ever done on the platform. And I did do my best to clarify afterwards that I certainly do don\u2019t mean anything antisemitic in that. The nature of the criticism was simply that the Jewish people have been persecuted for thousands of years. There is a natural affinity therefore for persecuted groups. This has led to the funding of organizations that essentially promote any persecuted group or any group with the perception of persecution. This includes radical Islamic groups. Everyone here has seen the massive demonstrations for Hamas in every major city in the west. That should be jarring. Well, a number of those organizations received funding from prominent people in the Jewish community. They didn\u2019t expect that to happen. But if you generically without condition sort of fund\u2026 If you fund persecuted groups in general, some of those persecuted groups unfortunately want your annihilation. And what I meant by that, when I subsequently clarified is that it\u2019s unwise to fund organizations that support groups that want your annihilation. Is this coming across clearly it at this point?", "I think logically this makes a lot of sense.", "Let\u2019s say you fund a group and that group supports Hamas who wants you to die. Perhaps you should not fund them, right?", "Thank you.", "All of that. Yeah, all of that. I mean, look, I\u2019m sorry for that tweet or post. It was foolish of me. Of the 30,000, it might be literally the worst and dumbest post that I\u2019ve ever done. And I try to do my best to clarify six ways to Sunday. But at least I think over time it\u2019ll be obvious that in fact, far from being antisemitic, I\u2019m in fact [inaudible 00:20:14] and all the evidence in my track record would support that.", "The aspiration for X is to be the global town square. Now, if you were to walk down to let\u2019s say Times Square, do you occasionally hear people saying crazy things?", "I mean, look, the joke I used to make about old Twitter was it was like giving everyone in the psych ward a megaphone. So I\u2019m aware that things can get promoted that are negative beyond the sort of circle of somebody simply screaming crazy things in Times Square, which happens all the time. Actually, it\u2019s pretty rare for something frankly that is hateful to be promoted. It\u2019s not that it never happens, but it\u2019s fairly rare. I mean, I would encourage people to look for those that use the system. When you look at the feed that you receive, how often is it hateful? And over time, has it gotten more or less hateful? I would say that if you look at the X platform today versus a year ago, I think it is actually much better. I mean, what is your personal experience?", "I\u2019m just curious. You use this-", "This is actually a challenge in that sometimes people will say, why is it showing me posts from this person that I hate?

I have more ideas than I could possibly execute, so I have no shortage of ideas. Innovation is not the problem. Execution is the problem. I\u2019ve got a million ideas. I\u2019ve got an entire design for an electric supersonic vertical takeoff jet, but if I just can\u2019t do that as well. I\u2019ve had that for 10 years. There\u2019s a million things.", "No.", "No.", "We need a psychiatrist couch here or something. I think to some degree, I was born this way and then I was amplified by a difficult childhood, frankly. But I can remember even in happy moments when I was a kid, that it just feels like there\u2019s just a rage of forces in my mind constantly. Now, this productively manifests itself in technology and building things for the most part. And I think on balance, the output has been very productive. I think the results, as we discussed earlier with SpaceX, Tesla, PayPal which is still going today, the first internet company that I started. In fact, the first internet company I started, Zipto, was funded by a New York Times Company, Hearst, Knight Ritter.", "And we wrote some of the software for the New York Times website and we helped bring online several hundred newspapers that previously were only in print. Now, this is in the \u201990s, which at this point is like, I\u2019m like a grandpa basically. The \u201990s and internet feels like a pre-Cambrian era when there were only sponges. Anyway, I feel like a lot of productive things have been done. And you can also look at Tesla as being many companies in one. Like if the Tesla supercharging network were its own company, it would be a Fortune 500 company by itself, just the supercharging system. We also make the cells, we build the power electronics and the powertrain from scratch. We have the most innovative structural design, the largest castings ever used. We have the best manufacturing technology at Tesla, better manufacturing technology than companies that have been doing it for 100 years. So these demons of the mind are, for the most part, harnessed to productive ends.", "That doesn\u2019t mean\u2026 Once in a while they go wrong.", "Prove to who.", "No. If I were to describe my philosophy, it is a philosophy of curiosity. I did have this existential crisis when I was around 12, about what\u2019s the meaning of life? Isn\u2019t it all pointless? Why not just commit suicide? Why exist? I read the religious texts. I read the philosophy books. That, especially the German philosophy books, made me quite depressed frankly. Want you not read Schopenhauer Nietzsche as a teenager. But then I read Douglas Adams\u2019 Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, which is a book on philosophy in the form of humor. And the point that Adamus was making there was that we don\u2019t actually know what questions to ask. That\u2019s why I said that, the answer is 42. Basically earth\u2019s a giant computer and it came up with the answer 42. But then to actually figure out what the question is, that\u2019s the actual hard part. And I think this is generally true also in physics. At the point at which you can properly frame the question, the answer is actually the easy part.\n\n(30:37)\nSo my motivation then was that, well, my life is finite, really a flash in the pan on a galactic timescale. But if we can expand the scope and scale of consciousness, then we are better able to figure out what questions to ask about the answer that is the universe. And maybe we can find out the meaning of life or even what the right question to ask is. Where do we come from? Where are we going? Where are the aliens? Are there aliens? These questions, is there new physics to discover? Because there seems to be some real questions around dark matter and dark energy. So the purpose of SpaceX is to extend life beyond earth on a sustained basis, so that we can at least pass one of the Fermi Great Filters, which is that of being a single-planet civilization.\n\n(31:53)\nIf we are single-planet civilization, then we are simply waiting around for some extinction event, whether that is manmade or natural. But if you\u2019re a single-planet civilization, eventually something will happen to that planet and you will die. If you\u2019re a multi-planet civilization, you\u2019ll live much longer. Also, multi-planet civilization, that\u2019s the natural stepping stone to being a multi-stellar civilization and being out there among the stars. So now, this I think has two\u2026 This is not simply a defensive motivation, but it is also one where that gives meaning, man\u2019s search for meaning.", "All right. Let me finish this philosophy point, even though it may seem rather esoteric, it may resonate with a few people. We must get past this Fermi Great Filter of being a single-planet civilization. And if we do that, we are more likely to understand the nature of the universe and what questions to ask. If you believe in the philosophy of curiosity, then I think you should support this ambition. Being a multi-planet species is more than simply life insurance for life collectively. That\u2019s a defensive reason. But I think also that life has to be more than simply solving one sad problem after another. There have to be reasons for you wake up in the morning and you\u2019re happy to be alive. There have to be reasons that you have to say, why are you excited about the future? What gives you hope? And if you aren\u2019t sure, ask your kids. And I think the idea of us being a space-faring civilization and being out there among the stars is incredibly inspiring and exciting and something to look forward to. And there need to be such things in the world.", "Well, sometimes they\u2019re right.", "Yes.", "Yes. Yes.", "I think what you trying to say is that, do I at this point think because I\u2019ve been right so many times for others who said I\u2019m wrong, that now I best believe I\u2019m right when, in fact, I\u2019m wrong?", "No, I\u2019m right. So yeah, no, look, here\u2019s the thing. Physics is unforgiving. Physics is unforgiving. I have these various little sayings that I\u2019ve come up with, that physics is the law and everything else is a recommendation.", "In the sense that you can break any law made by humans, but try breaking a law made by physics. That\u2019s much more difficult. So if you are wrong and persist in being wrong, the rockets will blow up and the cars will fail. So we\u2019re not trying to figure out what flavor of ice cream is the best flavor of ice cream. There\u2019s 1,000 things that can happen on a rocket flight, and only one of them gets the rocket to orbit. And so being wrong results in failure when dealing with physical objects.", "I hope he does.", "Yeah. Yeah. I actually agree with a lot of Jeff\u2019s motivations. Let me put it this way, if there was a button I could press that would delete Blue Origin, I wouldn\u2019t press it. So I think it\u2019s good that he\u2019s spending money on making rockets too. I\u2019d suggest perhaps he spend more time on it, but it\u2019s up to him. I should make a point here. So nothing any of my companies have done has been to stifle competition. In fact, we\u2019ve done the opposite. So at Tesla, we have open sourced our patents. Anyone can use our patents for free. How many companies do you know who\u2019ve done that? Can you name one? I can\u2019t. At SpaceX, we don\u2019t use patents. Once in a while we\u2019ll file a patent just so some patent troll doesn\u2019t cause trouble. But we\u2019ve done nothing anti-competitive. We\u2019ve done nothing to stop our competitors.", "I just want to clarify for the audience, because some companies have done anti-competitive things. I think the strange thing, the unusual thing about SpaceX and Tesla is that we\u2019ve done things that have helped our competition. So at Tesla, we have made our supercharger system open access. We\u2019ve made our charger technology available for free to the other manufacturers. No walled garden. We could have put a wall up, but instead we invited them in.", "I think it\u2019s important for the audience to understand that the reason I have these powers is not because of some anti-competitive actions. It\u2019s simply because we\u2019ve executed very well.", "There are other satellites out there, you know?", "Right.", "Okay.", "They use our product if it\u2019s better, then use somebody else\u2019s product if their other product\u2019s better.", "How is it a bad thing to make better products than other companies?", "What are you suggesting?", "Do you trust the government?", "Exactly.", "Like I said, we\u2019re not the only company who has communication satellites. Our satellites are just much better than theirs. So it\u2019s not like we have a monopoly, we just have the best product?", "I think at the end of the day, if we make bad products that people don\u2019t want to use, then the users will vote with their resources and use something else.", "Certainly, my company\u2019s overseen by regulators. Since SpaceX, Starlink, Tesla are overseen by cumulatively over 100 regulators, and actually more than that, a few hundred regulators because you\u2019ve got, we\u2019re in fifty-five countries. If you sum up all the times that I had an argument with regulators, of hundreds of regulators over decades, it can sound really terrible, except but they forgot to mention that there were 10 million regulations we complied with and only five that I disagreed with. But they list all the five and it sounds like, wow, this guy\u2019s a real maverick. I\u2019m like, yeah, but what about the 10 million we complied with?", "Well, it\u2019s not SpaceX.", "The best that the X platform can do is adhere to the laws of any given country. Do you think there\u2019s something more we could do than that?", "Well, first of all, Starlink and SpaceX do no business in China whatsoever. Tesla has one of four factories, four vehicle factories in China. And China is, I don\u2019t know, a quarter of our market or something like that. So it\u2019s a quarter of the market of one company. The same is true, by the way, of all the other car companies. They also have something on that order of a quarter of their sales in China. So if that\u2019s a problem for Tesla, it\u2019s a problem for every car company. I think one has to be careful about not conflating the various companies. Because I can only do things that are within the bounds of the law, I cannot do beyond that. My aspiration is to do as much good as possible and to be as productive as possible within the bounds of what is legal. More than that, I cannot do.", "Yeah. Jensen\u2019s awesome.", "Yes. There\u2019s a video of Jensen and me unpacking the first AI computer at OpenAI.", "Co-founded it, yeah. Well, the whole arc of OpenAI, frankly is a little troubling, because the reason for starting OpenAI was to create a counterweight to Google and DeepMind, which at the time had two-thirds of all AI talent and basically infinite money and compute. And there was no counterweight. It was a unipolar world. And Larry and Paige and I used to be very close friends, and I would stay at his house, and I would talk to Larry into the late hours of the night about AI safety. And it became apparent to me that Larry did not care about AI safety. I think perhaps the thing that gave it away was when he called me a speciest for being pro-humanity, as in a racist, but for species. So I\u2019m like, \u201cWait a second, what side are you on, Larry?\u201d And then I\u2019m like, okay, listen, this guy\u2019s calling me a speciest. He doesn\u2019t care about AI safety. We\u2019ve got to have some counterpoint here because this seems like we could be, this is no good.\n\n(47:01)\nSo OpenAI was actually started, and it was meant to be open source. I named it OpenAI after open source. It is in fact a closed source, super closed. It should be renamed super closed source for maximum profit AI. Because this is what it actually is. Fay loves irony. In fact, a friend of mine says, the way to predict outcomes is the most ironic outcome is the most\u2026 It\u2019s like his Occam\u2019s razor, the simplest explanation is most likely. And my friend Jonah\u2019s view is that the most ironic outcome is the most likely. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happened with OpenAI. It is gone from an open source foundation, a 5123, to suddenly it\u2019s like a $90 billion for-profit corporation with closed source. So I don\u2019t know how you go from here to there.", "I don\u2019t know how you get \u2026 Is this legal? I\u2019m like, \u201cThat\u2019s legal?\u201d", "That\u2019s correct. Larry refused to be friends with me after I recruited Ilya.", "I think we should be concerned about this because I think Ilya actually has a strong moral compass. He really sweats it over questions of what is right. And if Ilya felt strongly enough to want to fire Sam, well, I think the world should know what was that reason.", "I\u2019ve reached out, but he doesn\u2019t want to talk to anyone.", "I\u2019ve talked to a lot of people. I\u2019ve not found anyone who knows why. Have you?", "One of two things is, either it was a serious thing and we should know what it is or it was not a serious thing and then the board should resign.", "I have mixed feelings about Sam. The ring of power can corrupt, and he has the ring of power. So I don\u2019t know. I think I want to know why Ilya felt so strongly as to fire Sam. This sounds like a serious thing. I don\u2019t think it was trivial. And I\u2019m quite concerned that there\u2019s some dangerous element of AI that they\u2019ve created.", "Yes.", "That\u2019d be my guess.", "On the AI front, I\u2019m in somewhat of a quandary here because I\u2019ve thought AI could be something that would change the world in a significant way since I was in college, 30 years ago. Now, the reason I didn\u2019t go build AI right from the get-go was because I was uncertain about which edge of the double-edged sword would be sharper, the good edge or the bad edge.\n\n(50:58)\nSo I held off on doing anything on AI, could\u2019ve created, I think, a leading AI company, and OpenAI actually is that, because I was just uncertain, if you make this magic genie, what will happen, whereas I think building sustainable energy technology is much more of a single-edged sword that is single-edged good, making life multi-planetary, I think single-edged good, installing mostly single-edged good, giving people better connectivity to people that don\u2019t have connectivity or it\u2019s too expensive, I think is very much a good thing. Sonic was instrumental, by the way, in halting the Russian advance, and the Ukrainians said so. So I think, with AI, you\u2019ve got the magic genie problem. You may think you want a magic genie, but once that genie\u2019s out of the bottle, it\u2019s hard to say what happens.", "The genie is certainly poking its head out.", "It\u2019s funny, all these weights, they\u2019re just basically numbers in a common separated value file, and that\u2019s our digital god, the CSP file. I found that funny, but that\u2019s literally what it is. So I think it\u2019s coming pretty fast.", "If you say smarter than the smartest human at anything?", "It may not be then quite smarter than all humans, well, machine-augmented humans, because people have got computers and stuff. There\u2019s a higher bar, but you say it\u2019s more than any \u2026 can write as good a novel as, say, JK Rowling, or discover new physics, or invent new technology, I would say that we\u2019re less than three years from that point.", "Yeah. Data is very important. You could say data is probably more valuable than gold.", "Yes, X might be the single best source of data. People click on more links to X than anything else on earth. Sometimes people think Facebook or Instagram is a bigger thing, but actually, there are more links to X than anything. This is public information. You can Google it.", "So it is where you would find what is happening right now on earth at any given point in time. The whole OpenAI drama played out, in fact, on the X platform. Google certainly has a massive amount of data, so does Microsoft, but it is one of the best sources of data.", "Yeah, that\u2019s a huge lie.", "These AIs are all trained on copyrighted data, obviously.", "That\u2019s a lie.", "Yeah, straight up lie.", "100%. Obviously, it\u2019s been trained on copyrighted data.", "It\u2019s one every minute here.", "Yeah.", "I don\u2019t know, except to say that, by the time these lawsuits are decided, we\u2019ll have digital God. So I\u2019d ask digital God at that point. These lawsuits won\u2019t be decided before, on a timeframe that is relevant.", "There\u2019s that \u2026 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s actually a real Chinese thing or not, but may you live an interesting time is apparently not a good thing, but personally, I would prefer to live in interesting times, and we live in the most interesting of times. For awhile there, I was really getting demotivated and losing sleep over the threat of AI danger, and then I finally became fatalistic about it and said, \u201cWell, even if I knew annihilation was certain, would I choose to be alive at that time or not?\u201d And I said, \u201cI probably would choose to be alive at that time because it\u2019s the most interesting thing, even if there\u2019s nothing I could do about it.\u201d So then basically, a fatalistic resignation helped me sleep at night because I was having trouble sleeping at night because of AI danger.\n\n(58:43)\nNow, what to do about it? I\u2019ve been the one banging the drum the hardest, by far the longest, or at least one of longest for AI danger, and these regulatory things that are happening, the single biggest reason they\u2019re happening is because of me.", "Well, there\u2019s regulation around anything which is a physical danger, a danger to the public. So cars are heavily regulated, communications are heavily regulated, rockets and aircraft are heavily regulated. The general philosophy about regulation is that, when something is a danger to the public, that there needs to be some government oversight. So I think, in my view, AI is more dangerous than nuclear bombs and we regulate nuclear bombs. You can\u2019t just go make a nuclear bomb in your backyard. I think we should have some kind of regulation with AI. Now, this tends to cause the AI accelerationist to get up in arms because they think AI is heaven, basically.", "As I said a moment ago, one should not take what is viewed in the media as being the whole picture. There are literally hundreds, this is not an exaggeration, say, there are probably 100 million regulations that my companies comply with and there are probably five that we don\u2019t. And if we disagree with some of those regulations, it\u2019s because we think the regulation that is meant to do good doesn\u2019t actually do good.", "It\u2019s not defying regulations for the sake of defiance.", "No, I\u2019m saying you\u2019re fundamentally mistaken, and it should be obvious that you\u2019re mistaken. My company\u2019s automotive is heavily regulated. We would not be allowed to put cars on the road if we did not comply with this vast body of regulation. Now, you could fill up the stage with, literally six foot high, the regulations that you have to comply with to make a car. You could have a room full of phone books. That\u2019s how big the regulations are. And if you don\u2019t comply with all of those, you can\u2019t sell the car. And if we don\u2019t comply with all the regulations for rockets or for Starlink, they shut us down.\n\n(01:01:46)\nSo in fact, I am incredibly compliant with regulations. Now, once in awhile, there\u2019ll be something that I disagree with. The reason I would disagree with it is because I think the regulation, in that particular case, in that rare case, does not serve the public good. And therefore, I think it is my obligation to object to a regulation that is meant to serve the public good, but doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s the only time I object, not because I seek to object. In fact, I\u2019m incredibly rule-following.", "TikTok is-", "I don\u2019t use TikTok.", "I don\u2019t personally use it, but for teenagers and people in their 20s, they seem almost religiously addicted to TikTok. Some people will watch TikTok for two hours a day. I stopped using TikTok when I felt the AI probing my mind and it made me uncomfortable, so I stopped using it. And in terms of antisemitic content, TikTok is rife with that. It has the most viral antisemitic content by far.", "No.", "I don\u2019t think this is some Chinese Government plot, but the TikTok algorithm is entirely AI-powered. So it is really just trying to find the most viral thing possible. It\u2019s what is going to keep you glued to the screen. That\u2019s it. Now, on sheer numbers, there are on the order of two billion Muslims in the world, and I think a much smaller number of Jewish people, 20 million, something, many orders of magnitude fewer. So if you just look at content production, just on sheer numbers basis, this is going to be overwhelmingly antisemitic, just on a numbers basis.", "Have I?", "Well, doing nothing to provoke the Biden Administration, they held an electric vehicle summit at the White House and specifically refused to let Tesla attend. This was in the first six months of the administration. And we inquired, we\u2019re like, \u201cWe literally make more electric cars than everyone else combined. Why are we not allowed? Why are you only letting Ford, GM, Chrysler, and UAW, and you\u2019re specifically disallowing us from the EV summit at the White House?\u201d We had done nothing to provoke them. Then Biden went on to add insult to injury and publicly said that GM was leading the electric car revolution. This was in the same quarter that Tesla made 300,000 electric cars and GM made 26. Does that seem fair to you?", "And by the way, I had a great relationship with Obama. So this was not a-", "I voted for Obama. I stood in line for six hours to shake Obama\u2019s hand. Okay?", "And it hurt the company, too, and it was an insult to \u2026 Tesla has 140,000 employees. Half of them are in the United States. Tesla has created more manufacturing jobs than everyone else combined.", "Yeah, a real right-wing motive.", "God, far right, if anything.", "It\u2019s a reverse psychology, next level.", "Yeah, I disagree with him on that.", "Well, I haven\u2019t endorsed anyone for president. I wanted to hear what Vivek had to say because I think that some of the things he says, I think, are pretty solid. He\u2019s concerned about government overreach, about government control of information. The degree to which old Twitter was basically a sock puppet of the government was ridiculous. So it seems to me that there\u2019s a very severe violation of the First Amendment in terms of how much control the government had over old Twitter, and it no longer does.\n\n(01:08:04)\nSo there\u2019s a reason for the First Amendment. The reason for the First Amendment, for freedom of speech, is because the people that immigrated to this country came from places where there was not freedom of speech. And they were like, \u201cYou know what? We got to make sure that that\u2019s constitutional,\u201d because where they came from, if they said something, they\u2019d be put in prison or something bad would happen to them. And freedom of speech, you have to say, when is it relevant? It\u2019s only relevant when someone you don\u2019t like can say something you don\u2019t like or it has no meaning. And as soon as you throw in the towel and concede to censorship, it is only a matter of time before someone censors you. And that is why we have the First Amendment.", "I think I would not vote for Biden.", "I\u2019m not saying I\u2019d vote for Trump, but this is definitely a difficult choice here.", "No, I think that\u2019s outrageous. I\u2019m not going to vote for some pro-censorship candidate. Like I said, I think you have to consider that there\u2019s a lot of wisdom in these amendments, I mean, the constitution, and a lot of things that we take for granted here in the United States that don\u2019t even exist in Canada. There\u2019s no constitutional right to freedom of speech in Canada and there\u2019s no Miranda rights in Canada. People think you have the right to remain silent. You don\u2019t, actually, in Canada. I\u2019m half Canadian, I can say these things, I suppose. So the freedom of speech is incredibly important, even when people \u2026 And like I said, it\u2019s actually especially important, in fact, it is only relevant, when people you don\u2019t like can say things you don\u2019t like. [inaudible 01:10:40] they\u2019re meaningless.", "Look, we actually are in an odd situation here where, on balance, the Democrats appear to be more pro-censorship than the Republicans, and that used to be the opposite. It used to be left position was freedom of speech. I believe, at one point, the ACLU even defended the right of someone to claim that they were Nazi or something like that. So the left was freedom of speech is fundamental. My perception, perhaps it isn\u2019t accurate, is that the pro-censorship is more on the left than the right.", "\u2026 We certainly get more complaints from the left than the right, let me put it that way. But my aspiration for the X platform is that it is the best source of truth, or the least inaccurate source of truth. And while I don\u2019t know of you will believe me or not, but I think honesty is the best policy, and I think that the truth will win over time.\n\n(01:12:25)\nAnd we\u2019ve got this great system, and it\u2019s getting better, called Community Notes, which is fantastic I think at correcting falsehoods, or adding context. In fact, we make a point of not removing anything, but only adding context. Now that context could include that this is completely false and here\u2019s why. And no one is immune to this. I\u2019m not immune to it. Advertisers are not immune to it. In fact, we\u2019ve had Community Notes, which has caused us some loss in advertising. Speaking of loss in advertising revenue. If a community note\u2026 If there\u2019s false advertising, the Community Note will say, \u201cThis is false and here is why.\u201d\n\n(01:13:12)\nThere\u2019s one specific example that is public knowledge, so I\u2019ll mention it, which is at one point Uber had this ad which said, \u201cEarn like a boss.\u201d And it was community noted. \u201cIf by boss you mean $12 and forty-seven cents an hour.\u201d This did cause at least a temporary suspension of advertising from Uber.", "What did?", "Well, we do require that everyone has to buy a subscription, and we don\u2019t make exceptions for anyone. And I think if I want the New York Times, I have to pay for a subscription, and they don\u2019t give me a free subscription. So I\u2019m not going to give them a free subscription.", "They didn\u2019t buy a subscription. By the way, it only cost like $1000 a month. So if they just do that, then they\u2019re back in the saddle.", "No, I\u2019m saying-", "Any organization that refuses to buy a subscription is not going to be recommended.", "Free speech is not exactly free, it costs a little bit.", "Yeah. It\u2019s like in South Park where they say, \u201cFreedom isn\u2019t free, it costs a buck O\u2019 five.\u201d Or whatever. But it\u2019s pretty cheap. Okay? Low cost freedom.", "Freedom-", "Yeah.", "This is EV?", "Well, I think if you make a compelling electric car, people will buy it. No question about it. I mean electric car sales in China are gigantic. That\u2019s by far the biggest category, and I think that would be the case\u2026 I mean it\u2019s worth noting, so probably the best reputation of that is that the Tesla model Y will be the best selling car of any kind on earth this year, of any kind, gasoline or otherwise.", "I think the Chinese car companies are extremely competitive. By far our toughest competition is in China. So I mean there\u2019s a lot of people who are out there who think the top 10 car company\u2019s is going to be Tesla followed by nine Chinese car companies. I think they might not be wrong. So China is super good at manufacturing, and the work ethic is incredible. So if we consider different leagues of competitiveness at Tesla, we consider the Chinese league to be the most competitive. And by the way, we do very well in China because our China team is the best in China.", "Well, I mean I think it\u2019s generally not good to have an adversarial relationship between people on the line, one group at the company and another group. In fact, I disagree with the idea of unions, but perhaps for a reason that is different than people may expect, which is I just don\u2019t like anything which creates kind of a lords and peasants sort of thing. And I think the unions naturally try to create negativity in a company, and create a sort of lords and peasants situation.\n\n(01:18:25)\nThere are many people at Tesla who have gone from working on the line to being in senior management. There is no lords and peasants. Everyone eats at the same table. Everyone parks in the same parking lot. At GM there\u2019s a special elevator for only for senior executives. We have no such thing at Tesla.\n\n(01:18:45)\nAnd the thing is that I actually know the people on the line, because I worked on the line and I walked the line and I slept in the factory and I worked beside them. So I\u2019m no stranger to them. And there are actually many times where I\u2019ve said, \u201cWell, can\u2019t we just hold a union vote?\u201d But apparently a company is not allowed to hold a union vote, so it has to be somehow called for, but the unions can\u2019t do it. So I said, \u201cWell let\u2019s just hold a vote and see what happens.\u201d\n\n(01:19:18)\nThe actual problem is the opposite. It\u2019s not that people are trapped at Tesla building cars. The challenge is, how do we retain great people to do the hard work of building cars when they have six other opportunities that they can do that are easier? That\u2019s the actual difficulty, is that building cars is hard work and there are much easier jobs. And I just want to say that I\u2019m incredibly appreciative of those who build cars, and they know it.\n\n(01:19:51)\nSo I don\u2019t know, maybe we\u2019ll be unionized. I say if Tesla gets unionized it will be because we deserve it and we failed in some way. But we certainly try hard to ensure the prosperity of everyone. We give everyone stock options. We\u2019ve made many people who are just working the line who didn\u2019t even know what stocks were, we\u2019ve made the millionaires.", "well. I have to go to the bathroom sometimes.", "Well, about every three hours, I make a trip to the lavatory.", "No, I mean there\u2019ll be brief moments between meetings. I mean obviously, I have 17 jobs and no, I guess technically it\u2019s work at this point.", "Technically posting on Twitter or X is work. It does count as work. So there\u2019s that. But no, I mean I think I\u2019m on\u2026 Well I guess usually, probably I\u2019m on for longer than I think I am.", "If you look at the screen time of a number of hours per week, sometimes that\u2019s a scary number. It\u2019s probably, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s a little over an hour a day, or something like that.", "Yeah.", "Okay.", "Yeah, screen time. Sometimes this is a scary number though.", "I just got a new phone, so I think this is not accurate. It\u2019s one minute. Pretty sure it\u2019s more than that. Wait, it\u2019s over the week. There we go.", "Okay, so it\u2019s still wrong. It\u2019s more than four minutes. I just got a new phone, so this is not accurate. It literally says four minutes.", "New phone. [inaudible 01:22:45].", "The idea of making a phone\u2026 What do you mean like-", "The app store?", "I mean, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a real need to make a phone. I mean, if there\u2019s an essential need to make a phone, I\u2019ll make a phone, but I\u2019ve got a lot of fish to fry. So I mean I do think there\u2019s a fundamental challenge that phone makers have at this point because you\u2019ve got basically a black rectangle. How do you make that better?", "No, that\u2019s literally\u2026 Yeah, good phrase, in the head. A neural link.", "The best interface would be a neural interface directly to your brain. So that would be a neural link.", "Yeah, actually this is\u2026 The USDA inspector who came by Neuralink facilities literally said in her entire career she has never seen a better animal care facility. We are the nicest to animals that you could possibly be, even to the rats and mice, even though they did the plague and everything. So it is like monkey paradise.\n\n(01:24:35)\nSo the thing that gets conflated is that there were some terminal monkeys, where, this is actually several years ago, where the monkeys were about to die and we\u2019re like, okay, we\u2019ve got an experimental device. It\u2019s a kind of thing which you would only put on a monkey that\u2019s about to die. And then now the monkey died, but it didn\u2019t die because of the Neuralink, it died because it had a terminal case of cancer or something like that.\n\n(01:24:57)\nNeuralink has never caused the death of a monkey, to the best\u2026 Unless they\u2019re hiding something from me, it\u2019s never caused death of a monkey. And in fact, we\u2019ve now had monkeys with Neuralink implants for two, three years and they\u2019re doing great. And we\u2019ve even replaced the Neuralink twice and we\u2019re getting ready to do the first implants, hopefully in a few months. The only implementations of Neuralink I think are unequivocally good. Speaking of the double-edged sword, I think these early implementations are single-edged sword, because the first implementations will be to enable people who have lost the brain-body connection to be able to operate a computer or a phone faster than someone who has hands that work. So you can imagine if Stephen Hawking could communicate faster than someone who had full-body functionality, how incredible that would be. Well, that\u2019s what this device will do, and we should have proof of that in a human, hopefully in a few months.\n\n(01:26:07)\nIt already works in monkeys and works quite well with monkeys that can play video games just by thinking. So in the next application after dealing with tetraplegics and quadriplegics is going to be vision. Vision is the next thing. So it\u2019s like if somebody has lost both eyes, or the optic nerve has failed, basically where they have no possibility of having some ocular correction. That would be the next thing for Neuralink, is a direct vision interface. And in fact, then you could be like Geordi La Forge from Star Trek. You could see in any frequency, actually you could see in radar if you want.", "Not as well as Neuralink will though.", "Yes. Well, first of all, humans are terrible drivers. So people text and drive, they drink and drive, they get into arguments, they do all sorts of things in cars that they should not do. So it\u2019s actually remarkable that there are not more deaths than there are. What we\u2019ll find with computer driving is, I think probably an order of magnitude reduction in deaths.\n\n(01:28:45)\nAnd the US has actually far fewer deaths per capita than the rest of the world. If you go worldwide, I think there\u2019s something close to a million deaths per year due to automotive accidents. So I think computer driving will probably drop that by 90% or more. It won\u2019t be perfect, but it\u2019ll be 10 times better.", "Well, in large numbers, it will simply be so obviously true that it really cannot be denied.", "Sure, of course. Wait, I shouldn\u2019t have said that. So yeah, I\u2019m optimistic about\u2026 I think I\u2019m naturally optimistic about time scales, and if I was not naturally optimistic, I wouldn\u2019t be doing the things that I\u2019m doing. I mean, I certainly wouldn\u2019t have sold a rocket company or electric car company if I didn\u2019t have some sort of pathological optimism, frankly.\n\n(01:30:04)\nSo as you pointed out, many people said that it would fail. And in fact, actually I agreed with them. I said, \u201cYes, it probably will fail.\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cHmm, okay.\u201d But I thought SpaceX and Tesla had less than a 10% chance of success when we started them. So yeah, anyway. But the self-driving thing is, I\u2019ve been optimistic about it, but we\u2019ve certainly made a lot of progress. If anybody has tried, has been using the sort of full self-driving beta, the progress every year has been substantial.\n\n(01:30:42)\nIt\u2019s really now at the point where in most places it\u2019ll take you from one place to another with no interventions. And the data is unequivocal that supervised full self-driving is somewhere around four times safer or maybe more, than just a human driving by themselves. So I can certainly see it coming. Actually, really-", "No, no, no, definitely not. Definitely not.", "Well, I mean I think they\u2019ve all, with rare exception, thought it wasn\u2019t happening. So they were investing, despite thinking, they\u2019re very clear that they don\u2019t think it\u2019s real. So they\u2019re not saying, \u201cOh, we just believe everything Elon says, hook, line, and sinker.\u201d But the thing is that, I mean, it would be a fair criticism of me to say that I\u2019m late, but I always deliver in the end.", "Right.", "Well, I think it\u2019s quite literally-", "Well, I was encouraging people to amplify empathy, literally. I tend to be quite literal.", "I think I was talking to some friends, and we all agreed that we should try to amplify empathy. And so I wrote amplify empathy.", "Look, sometimes it\u2019s pretty simple.", "All right. Thank you.", "[inaudible 01:33:04]."]
