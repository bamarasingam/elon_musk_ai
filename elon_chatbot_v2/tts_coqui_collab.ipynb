Here's a brief overview of his life and legacy:\n","\n","Early Life:\n","\n","Terry Fox was born on July 28, 1958, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. He grew up in Port Coquitlam, British Columbia, with his parents, Rolly and Betty Fox, and his three siblings. Terry developed a passion for sports, particularly running, at a young age.\n","\n","Marathon of Hope:\n","\n","In 1977, Terry Fox was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer, at the age of 18. He underwent limb salvage surgery, which involved amputating his right leg above the knee. During his treatment, Terry developed a new sense of purpose and became determined to make a difference in the fight against cancer.\n","\n","To raise money for cancer research, Terry decided to embark on an ambitious and arduous journey: running across Canada, a distance of approximately 8,000 kilometers. He dubbed his quest the \"Marathon of Hope.\"\n","\n","On April 12, 1980, Terry set off from St. John's, Newfoundland, and began his run across the country. For 143 days, he faced numerous challenges, including grueling terrain, harsh weather conditions, and physical pain. Despite this, he inspired hundreds of thousands of people along the way.\n","\n","The Marathon of Hope captured the hearts and minds of Canadians, and Terry's determination and courage raised millions of dollars for the Canadian Cancer Society. However, his journey was cut short when the cancer spread to his lungs, and he was forced to stop running on September 1, 1980.\n","\n","Legacy:\n","\n","Terry Fox's legacy extends far beyond his courageous run across Canada. He inspired a nation to support cancer research and raised over $24 million for the Canadian Cancer Society.\n","\n","In 1981, Terry passed away on June 28, at the age of 22, but his spirit and determination continued to inspire people around the world. The Terry Fox Run, which was organized by the Canadian Cancer Society, has become an annual event, with millions of participants worldwide.\n","\n","Terry Fox's story has been immortalized in numerous books, films, and documentaries, cementing his place as a Canadian icon and a symbol of courage, perseverance, and inspiration.\n","\n","In 2005, a documentary about Terry's life and journey, \"Terry Fox: A Canadian Hero,\" was released, and in 2012, a feature film, \"Terry,\" was produced as a tribute to his life.\n","\n","Terry Fox's legacy continues to inspire people of all ages, and his story serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of hope, resilience, and the human spirit.\n","Generating speech...\n"," > Text splitted to sentences.\n","['Terry Fox (1958-1981) was a Canadian athlete, humanitarian, and cancer survivor who became a national hero and inspiration to millions.', \"Here's a brief overview of his life and legacy:\", 'Early Life:', 'Terry Fox was born on July 28, 1958, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'He grew up in Port Coquitlam, British Columbia, with his parents, Rolly and Betty Fox, and his three siblings.', 'Terry developed a passion for sports, particularly running, at a young age.', 'Marathon of Hope:', 'In 1977, Terry Fox was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, a type of bone cancer, at the age of 18.', 'He underwent limb salvage surgery, which involved amputating his right leg above the knee.', 'During his treatment, Terry developed a new sense of purpose and became determined to make a difference in the fight against cancer.', 'To raise money for cancer research, Terry decided to embark on an ambitious and arduous journey: running across Canada, a distance of approximately 8,000 kilometers.', 'He dubbed his quest the \"Marathon of Hope.\"', \"On April 12, 1980, Terry set off from St. John's, Newfoundland, and began his run across the country.\", 'For 143 days, he faced numerous challenges, including grueling terrain, harsh weather conditions, and physical pain.', 'Despite this, he inspired hundreds of thousands of people along the way.', \"The Marathon of Hope captured the hearts and minds of Canadians, and Terry's determination and courage raised millions of dollars for the Canadian Cancer Society.\", 'However, his journey was cut short when the cancer spread to his lungs, and he was forced to stop running on September 1, 1980.', 'Legacy:', \"Terry Fox's legacy extends far beyond his courageous run across Canada.\", 'He inspired a nation to support cancer research and raised over $24 million for the Canadian Cancer Society.', 'In 1981, Terry passed away on June 28, at the age of 22, but his spirit and determination continued to inspire people around the world.', 'The Terry Fox Run, which was organized by the Canadian Cancer Society, has become an annual event, with millions of participants worldwide.', \"Terry Fox's story has been immortalized in numerous books, films, and documentaries, cementing his place as a Canadian icon and a symbol of courage, perseverance, and inspiration.\", 'In 2005, a documentary about Terry\\'s life and journey, \"Terry Fox: A Canadian Hero,\" was released, and in 2012, a feature film, \"Terry,\" was produced as a tribute to his life.', \"Terry Fox's legacy continues to inspire people of all ages, and his story serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of hope, resilience, and the human spirit.\"]\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["The attention mask is not set and cannot be inferred from input because pad token is same as eos token.
