BARRY HURD:
03:00:45;26 "We feel like we're standing in the future [here]" Is that
the way you still feel when you come here? What’s going
on here?
 ELON MUSK:
03:01:00;22 Well, it is easy to get somewhat blasé about a rocket
factory if you're here every day. But it's true what you're
saying. I mean, this really is a rocket factory. And you're
walking around and that's a rocket engine. And that's a
stage that's going to go to orbit. And that's a space craft
that's gonna carry people to the space station. And these
are, actually, pretty remarkable things. But I have to
remind myself of that from time to time because as I walk
around, all I tend to see are how we're gonna fix that. We
gotta improve this. We gotta change that design. So I
have to sort of bring myself back, think about the big
picture and remind myself that this is, actually, pretty cool,
unusual stuff. 
PG.3
 BARRY HURD:
03:01:41;16 When you first got the vision for this, however that
happened, were you more enthusiastic about an idea or a
business?
 ELON MUSK:
03:01:50;11 The reason I'm doing Space EX is not due to some
childhood epiphany or because I think this is the highest
return on your investment [or] a way to spend money. I
think starting a rocket company is an unusual thing to do
and pretty risky. But I'm a big believer in us becoming a
space exploring civilization and, ultimately, extending life
beyond earth. When I was in college I tried to think what
are the really big problems that face the world, that, which
will most affect the future of humanity?
03:02:26;24 And the three that I thought were the most important were
the Internet, transition to a sustainable energy economy,
and third was space exploration, in particular, making life
multi-planetary. And I didn't really think I'd have anything
to do with the third one because that seemed like the 
PG.4
process of governments, largely or entirely.
03:02:53;19 And I wasn't sure how I could get involved in sustainable
energy, although, that was the path that I originally
started on. That's what originally brought me to Silicon
Valley: to do a PhD at Stanford in energy storage
technologies for electric vehicles.
 BARRY HURD:
03:03:09;27 The story is that after two days you left.
 ELON MUSK:
03:03:12;10 Yeah, that's right.
 BARRY HURD:
03:03:12;29 Tell me about that. That's kind of funny how did that
[happen]? Just two days?
 ELON MUSK:
03:03:15;18 Well, I didn't even go to classes, actually. It was two days
into the quarter. And I was sort of forced to choose. You
know, it's either start the grad program or, you know, do
my Internet company.
 BARRY HURD: 
PG.5
03:03:31;10 Tell me a little bit about that? You're ready to go to
Stanford and this other idea from the Internet starts up.
Now, how did that happen?
 ELON MUSK:
03:03:38;16 Well, remember how I said that when I was just towards
the end of my undergrad, I was thinking that the Internet
would be something that would really fundamentally
change the world and change humanity forever in a very
significant way. It seemed to me like humanity was
acquiring a nervous system.
03:03:57;28 And, you know, previously, you had people that were sort
of isolated cells, if you will, that with the communications
mechanisms were weak. And there's really no way that
any one cell had access to all the information of the
collective consciousness. You know, you'd have to go to
libraries here and there and talk to people and that sort of
thing. But the way it is today, if you could be in the
jungles of Congo and have a satellite link to the Internet
and AC, have access to essentially the entire knowledge of 
PG.6
humanity. I mean, that's pretty intense. I mean, that's a
huge, huge difference.
 BARRY HURD
03:04:38;02 When was this?
 ELON MUSK:
03:04:39;01 I think '94.
 BARRY HURD:
03:04:39;22 '94.
 ELON MUSK:
03:04:41;01 Yeah.
 BARRY HURD:
03:04:41;26 Okay, and so that's when you started concentrating then
on the Internet as the first of these three ideas?
 ELON MUSK:
03:04:46;11 Yeah, so then in '95, I mean, I'd been on the Internet for a
few years before that because, you know, since I've been
in the physics arena and the sciences people were using
the Internet for many years, as early as the '70s, they
were using the Internet. But it was very difficult to use. It
was text based. It was very difficult to get access to it. 
PG.7
You had to be either in the government or in some
academic institution. But once it became clear that the
Internet was going to be widespread, that everyone would
have access to it, that's when it occurred to me that this is
really gonna fundamentally change humanity. And that
became clear around about the '94 timeframe.
 BARRY HURD:
03:05:28;04 Are you a programmer?
 ELON MUSK:
03:05:30;22 I taught myself how to program computers when I was a
kid. And bought my first computer when I was ten and
sold my first commercial program when I was 12.
 BARRY HURD:
03:05:41;16 Not bad.
 ELON MUSK:
03:05:42;11 Yeah, made a lot of money for a little kid.
 BARRY HURD:
03:05:45;09 So take me from your programming to [what led to] Papal.
But you programmed, was it Xcom, maybe I don't have
the story right? How did that all come about? 
PG.8
 ELON MUSK:
03:05:59;12 Right, right. Well, I had a company before that which was
called Zip Two, which people wouldn't generally have
heard of. But it did things like maps and directions and
yellow pages. And it, also, did e-mail, accounting,
personalization. But really that software was provided to
the major media companies like the New York Times,
Hearst, and Knight Rider to power their websites. And it
had a much more functional Experience for the user.
03:06:29;23 So my first company was not a consumer company. It was
primarily providing Internet software to media companies
to enable them to go online. But then the second
company, PayPal, started off, originally, as EX.com. And
then about a year after that the company merged with
another company called Confinity. And both Confinity and
EX had started from very different places.
03:07:00;22 EX had started off as a financial services company. The
idea was to aggregate all of your financial services
seamlessly in one place and make it really easy to use so 
PG.9
you don't have to go to multiple financial institutions to
take care of your mortgage, your credit cards, your
banking relationship, insurance, mutual funds. You can
just go in one location. And we had a feature which was
the ability to e-mail money to anyone in the system.
 BARRY HURD:
03:07:25;10 Was that the real sort of big headline?
 ELON MUSK:
03:07:28;14 Well, it was very easy to implement in the beginning. It
gets harder to implement over time as you are forced to
minimize the fraud in a system. But the initial
implementation of e-mail payments is very [easy], it's
really trivial. But anyhow, we had that as a feature.
03:07:45;23 And whenever we demonstrated the system to people,
they wouldn't get excited about the aggregation of
financial services. But they got really wowed by the fact
that you could e-mail to somebody. And we were, like,
"Wow, okay, that's the easy part." But we started focusing
on that. Just let folks in on the e-mail payments part of it 
PG.10
and then Confinity came in from a different area. They
started off as a Palm Pilot cryptography program and then
developed an application with that cryptography which was
to be able to beam money tokens by the infrared port of a
Palm Pilot. So you remember back in the day [that] Palm
Pilots didn't have any connectivity, really? But they had
the infrared ports. They could beam little things back and
forth.
03:08:28;16 So you could beam money between Palm Pilots. And then
they also had a website which was called PayPal where you
would reconcile those payments. So you had your tokens
and your Palm Pilot. You plug into your [port] and then
you'd log onto the PayPal website and that's how the
beamed money tokens were transferred.
03:08:48;03 And then they added a feature. "Oh, well, let's just allow
people to just use the website without using the Palm
Pilot." And so we sort of converged to the same business
model. And then in early 2000 about a year after both 
PG.11
companies were formed and only a few months after we
launched our respective websites we merged the
companies, with EX.com acquiring Confinity. And initially,
the company was known as EX.com. And then we used
PayPal as the consumer brand. And then about a year
after the merger, we changed the company's name from
EX.com to PayPal to match the name of the product.
 BARRY HURD:
03:09:27;05 So if you were to go back and say what was the big
innovation about PayPal that really made it catch on and
rise to the top, what would it be?
 ELON MUSK:
03:09:36;00 This gets complicated. But I'll [try].
 BARRY HURD:
03:09:39;13 I have a high school education.
 ELON MUSK:
03:09:40;05 There's a number of factors because PayPal was not the
first to do e-mail payments. So you have to say, "Well,
why did it succeed where others did not?" There was a
company that was acquired by Amazon, started by Danny 
PG.12
Shader, I forget what it was called. But it was, also, an email payments company. There was a company called
Billpoint that was acquired by EBay which did e-mail
payments.
03:10:07;03 So how is it that PayPal was able to beat all of them? And
in particular, how was it able to beat Billpoint when
Billpoint was EBay's in-house service. Very few people
understand why. There's a couple of things [which made it
succeed].
03:10:26;00 First of all, if you look at the online economics of the
system, we figured out a way to authenticate bank
accounts. So normally it's really hard to authenticate bank
accounts from the standpoint of pulling money from
someone's bank account 'cause you can give us a bank
account number.
03:10:44;22 But how do we know it's you, right? The Federal Reserve
has no authentication system that works for pulling money
from people's accounts. But we came up with an idea for 
PG.13
authenticating by making two small deposits in
somebody's bank account which effectively made it a four
digit pin. So only the person who had that bank account
could
 tell what the four digit pin was because of those two little
tiny deposits.
 BARRY HURD:
03:11:12;19 The authentication process that…
 ELON MUSK:
03:11:14;14 We figured out how to authenticate a bank account without
anyone even seeing you.
 BARRY HURD:
03:11:19;21 And that's a breakthrough, right?
 ELON MUSK:
03:11:21;26 That was one of the fundamental breakthroughs. There
were many.
 BARRY HURD:
03:11:24;03 Well, just tell me one more; that's pretty big right there.
 ELON MUSK:
03:11:26;26 That's a very big one. And the reason it's very big is 
PG.14
because when you send money from one person to
another, if you send it using a credit card you have a very
high fee associated with that. But if you send it using an
electronic check it only costs a few cents. Plus, the
electronic check is very likely to be fraudulent but whereas
credit cards, there's a huge amount of fraud associated
with credit cards. So with the credit card system, your
effective cost, including fraud, is probably about three and
a half percent of the transaction. But the effective costs of
the electronic check are maybe a quarter of a percent.
 BARRY HURD:
03:12:06;14 So there's a big economic comparison there that makes
sense, yeah.
 ELON MUSK:
03:12:09;25 Yeah, absolutely.
 BARRY HURD:
03:12:11;01 So you had a better authentication and a better business
model.
 ELON MUSK:
03:12:13;09 We figured out how to authenticate bank accounts. We've 
PG.15
also introduced features that encourage people to keep
money in their PayPal account, which no one else did. So
we had a debit card, a MasterCard debit card that could
access your PayPal account. So you could buy stuff at a
restaurant and it just directly came out of your PayPal
account. So you don't need to transfer it to a bank to use
it in everyday life. You could, also, get cash from an ATM.
In fact, I have a card. I have one of the first cards ever.
In fact, I have the first card ever.
 BARRY HURD:
03:12:41;15 This is the first card?
 ELON MUSK:
03:12:41;24 I had, actually, the very first card, but, I lost it. And then
I had to get it replaced.
 BARRY HURD:
03:12:51;27 So tell me, again, what this is.
 ELON MUSK:
03:12:53;23 Well, I had the first debit card attached to the PayPal
system. And what this [is]…
 BARRY HURD: 
PG.16
03:13:00;20 Is that it?
 ELON MUSK:
03:13:01;00 Yeah, it's a MasterCard debit card. But it's a very
important bridge to the material world, because not
everything can be paid for online. You wanna go to a
restaurant or you wanna get cash out of an ATM, you need
this bridge to the regular world. But by having that card
and by, also, instituting a money market account so you
could earn interest on money in your PayPal account,
meant you didn't need to transfer it to your bank. Now,
you could leave the money in your PayPal account. Now, if
you send money to someone, it just comes out of your
PayPal account. Well, that's even cheaper than an
electronic check.
03:13:33;28 So, you know, if a credit card costs, say, three and a half
percent, an electronic check costs a quarter percent an
internal PayPal transfer costs maybe .01 percent,
[essentially] nothing. So as the percentage of electronic
check transfers and internal PayPal transfers increased
over time, it meant that our effective fees, the fees that 
PG.17
PayPal needed to charge to make money were much less
than any other competing system. So we could undercut
everyone including EBay's own service.
 BARRY HURD:
03:14:10;28 Now, you know, that kind of bridges this question I was
gonna ask you. I mean, when you look at [your] private
rocket ship company and you look at NASA, what do you
do differently here that is obviously gonna give you an
advantage over how our government would approach
doing space colonization and travel?
 ELON MUSK:
03:14:23;16 Sure, and by the way, on the PayPal stuff, I just touched
on a subset of things.
 BARRY HURD:
03:14:28;29 If I had more time I'd ask you to go through more. I don't
have time, though.
 ELON MUSK:
03:14:30;01 Exactly, that's why… I can write a treatise on the thing.
 BARRY HURD:
03:14:32;25 Well, we'll come back sometime and we'll go over the rest 
PG.18
of it.
 ELON MUSK:
03:14:36;05 I mean, there are many nuances to the thing. I think it's
worth noting that when somebody has a breakthrough
innovation, it is rarely one little thing. Very rarely, is it
one little thing. It's usually a whole bunch of things that
collectively amount to a huge innovation. But the problem
is, because it's hard to convey a complicated thing to
people, the innovator or the innovator's PR department will
say, "Oh, such and such is the reason why it's better," just
a little catch phrase. You know, like what is it with EBay?
[Something]like, Pam wanted to do beanie babies or
something. I mean, really that's not the basis for EBay.
But that was, like, the PR department.
 ELON MUSK:
03:15:18;19 The Pez dispenser, that's right. I'm, like…
 BARRY HURD:
03:15:20;16 And that's not even for a story, is it?
 ELON MUSK:
03:15:22;04 So, anyway, yeah, it's, like, something the PR department 
PG.19
made up. So really, its innovation is a collection of
complex things that are usually difficult to convey so there
is some sound byte that's given. You know, why is
Southwest Airlines the most popular airline in the whole
business? It's not just because they use 737s. Okay, I
mean, if it was that easy, everyone could do it, anyway.
 BARRY HURD:
03:15:49;26 Also that part about the people who are doing this they're
all thinking in a different way. And it's traditional to come
up with these breakthroughs. Tell me a little bit about how
that works. Don't you have to have a vision that's
different and try to execute something that maybe people
are against?
 ELON MUSK:
03:16:13;08 Sorry, can you repeat the question?
 BARRY HURD:
03:16:13;17 Yeah, I'm saying, in order to do these breakthroughs, all
these different things, you said it's a combination of a lot
of things. But you have to think differently about what?
 ELON MUSK: 
PG.20
03:16:20;17 Yeah, you do have to think differently. Absolutely.
 BARRY HURD:
03:16:22;14 So tell me about that process. How do you train yourself
to think differently and surround yourself with people that
do that as well? Or maybe you don't do that. I mean,
how do you get into an organization?
 ELON MUSK:
03:16:40;12 I think, generally, their {other people’s} thinking process
is too bound by convention or analogy to prior
experiences. So it's very rare that people try to think of
something on a first principles basis. They'll say, "We'll do
that because it's always been done that way." Or they'll
not do it because, "Well, nobody has ever done that. So it
must not be good." But that's just a ridiculous way to
think.
03:17:10;01 I mean, you have to build up the reasoning from the
ground up from first principles as in the phrase that's used
in physics. So you look at the fundamentals and construct
your reasoning from that and then see if you have a 
PG.21
conclusion that works or doesn't work. And it may or may
not be different from what people have done in the past.
It's harder to think that way, though. Sorry.
 BARRY HURD:
03:17:33;29 Why is it so hard to think that way? And how have you
managed to? I mean, obviously, you've thought the other
way. How have you broken that path?
 ELON MUSK:
03:17:47;16 I don't know. I've just always thought that way, I
suppose. I mean, I would always think about something
and whether that thing was really true or not. Could
something else be true or is there a better conclusion that
one could draw that's more probable? I don't know. I
was doing that when I was in elementary school. And I
would just question things. Or, maybe, it's sort of built-in
[to our nature] to question things.
 BARRY HURD:
03:18:14;28 I wanna go back to [the] nuts and bolts and PayPal. Tell
me about how Bill…
 ELON MUSK: 
PG.22
03:18:17;14 It would infuriate my parents, by the way.
 BARRY HURD:
03:18:18;25 I'm sorry, say that again.
 ELON MUSK:
03:18:19;17 It would infuriate my parents.
 BARRY HURD:
03:18:21;09 That you would think differently about things, or, what?
 ELON MUSK:
03:18:24;02 That I wouldn't just believe them when they said
something 'cause I'd ask them why. And then I'd consider
whether that response made sense given everything else I
knew.
 BARRY HURD:
03:18:32;00 Now, you have, what, five kids? Are any of them doing
that back to you?
 ELON MUSK:
03:18:35;12 Yes. Well, one of them in particular just asks "why" a lot.
He's a master of the chained “why.”
 BARRY HURD:
03:18:41;26 So that whole thing about, you know, you're gonna get 
PG.23
where you are to drive you nuts, right, did they tell you
that? "We hope you get a kid just like you?"
 ELON MUSK:
03:18:48;17 Yeah well, you know, inheritability of traits is much greater
than I thought. I mean, I'd assume that in the nature
versus nurture, there's much more nurture. But having
had five kids, I think its much more nature. I mean, what
are you? You're hardware and software, right?
03:19:10;19 So the difference between one person and the next must
either be a hardware difference or a software difference.
And why are kids that may have the exact same
background or same school, same everything, get those
widely different capabilities. Yet, they have the same
input experiences. Well, then it must be the hardware
that's different.
 BARRY HURD:
03:19:30;12 Yep, take me back to PayPal how you built that up, sold it
off, and then started going to these other businesses. I'm
just trying to get some connective part of the story, now. 
PG.24
 ELON MUSK:
03:19:40;26 Sure, well, so I built up Zip Two, the first company. I sold
that to Compaq for about $300 million. And then I wanted
to still do another company on the Internet. And that's
what I thought: "Well, where is there still room for a lot of
innovation on the Internet?"
03:19:56;22 And that's how I chose the financial services sector
because money is just an entry in a database. And it's low
bandwidth. You don't need any big infrastructure upgrade
on the Internet to make it work. And so it seemed like
there must be room for innovation.
03:20:08;22 And that's how I decided to do something in the financial
services arena even though I really had, essentially,
almost no background in financial services except for an
internship at a bank. And anyways, then PayPal went
public. We sold PayPal to EBay for about a billion and a
half.
03:20:26;23 And then I wanted to do something different, something 
PG.25
outside of the Internet arena. I was a little burnt out on
the Internet, having been immersed in it and spending
every day of my life on it for a long time. And that's
where I thought: "Well, you know, I've got a bit of capital.
03:20:42;18 "Let me see if I can do something in the space arena."
And I initially started out with this idea: "Well, let me do a
small philanthropic mission that will generate public
interest." And so I gathered from engineers, from the
space business, and started to learn more and more about
what it took to do space missions.
03:21:00;03 And, but I came to the conclusion that really the problem,
the reason why we weren't making more advancements in
space was not that there wasn't enough public will. I think
there's, actually, plenty of public will for space exploration
particularly in the United States which is a nation of
explorers. And I came to the conclusion that really there
was a fundamental problem with space transportation.
03:21:21;15 And if the space transportation costs hundreds of millions 
PG.26
of dollars and billions of dollars and people don't think
there's a way of doing it that doesn't bankrupt us, they're
not gonna want to do it. So we've gotta figure out a way
to do it that's affordable and workable and reliable. And
that's why I started Space EX, it's really to try to make a
huge difference, at least, in order of magnitude of more
difference in the cost of space transportation and in the
magnitudes of the capability of space transportation
because we need very big rockets if we're going to, you
know, make life multi-planetary.
 BARRY HURD:
03:21:58;04 So the vision here is the movement of people to planets?
Or is it just to supply a space station for awhile and see
what happens?
 ELON MUSK:
03:22:05;09 Well definitely, the long time vision is to help make life
multi-planetary. So really these are all steps along the
way to doing that. So we're starting off with a small
rocket capable of putting half-ton satellites into orbit.
We're about to do our third launch which will carry an air 
PG.27
force satellite and two small NASA satellites in about a
month. And then we've got our big rocket under
development, the Falcon Nine, which will, actually, be the
most capable rocket in the world or at least, the Falcon
Nine Heavy, which is a larger variant of it with two side
boosters, will be the most capable rocket in the world.
03:22:42;04 And we, also, have our Dragon Space Craft. And then a
couple years ago, we won the contract to design, build and
operate the successor to the space shuttle which retires in
2010. So we will be taking supplies to the space station,
[and] returning them to earth.
03:22:57;00 And then NASA has an option to add manned capability to
our system, you know, to pay us to do [human] transport
as well which we think they will exercise. And we're,
actually, designing the whole system with people in mind
from the beginning. So it's really a relatively small
difference from one to the next.
 BARRY HURD: 
PG.28
03:23:18;00 And to most people, I mean, we're coming and we're
looking at this and we're thinking NASA. Compare and
contrast the NASA approach and your approach at Space
EX a little for me so we see the difference.
 ELON MUSK:
03:23:29;09 Sure, well, it's important to appreciate that the actual
hardware construction is done by semi- private companies.
I mean, Boeing and Lockheed are the two biggest
contractors to NASA. So when you see a rocket getting
launched it is either a Boeing or a Rocky, Lockheed Rocket,
typically.
03:23:46;29 NASA does not build the rockets. But NASA will contract
with the aerospace companies, the big company
contractors to develop and build these rockets. And that's
typically done in a cost plus manner, where there's just a
big fee, or there's a fee, or a total contract value and then
Boeing and Lockheed will earn a fee that is a percentage of
that contract value. 
PG.29
03:24:13;20 And if that cost increases, then they earn more. So
actually it's not a very good incentive scheme because
they’re incented [sic] to make it more costly. And that's
one of the problems that plague the cost of space
exploration. You know, one of the big differences we're
aiming for here is full reusability.
03:24:34;01 No one has ever developed a fully developed, a fully
reusable orbital transportation system. That will be a
really, really big breakthrough if we can do it. It's a very
tough problem. You know the Soviet Union tried to solve
[it]. The United States government tried to solve [it] and
spent tens of billions of dollars collectively trying to do that
and did not succeed. So it's a tough problem. We're
gonna try to do it though with Falcon Nine.
 BARRY HURD:
03:24:59;24 What's your plan if we go on two, four, six, eight years of
what's gonna happen, like, next year or the year after?
What are the benchmarks you're trying to achieve here at
Space EX? 
PG.30
 ELON MUSK:
03:25:11;10 Well, on launching Falcon One we are going to be
launching Falcon Nine sometime next year. We expect it
to have the rocket at Cape Canaveral around the end of
[this] year and launch sometime next year. And that'll
carry both heavy satellites over ten-tons to orbit as well as
transport our Dragon Space Craft, deliver it to orbit so it
can go to the space station and be re-supplied. So two
years from now, we expect to have launched our big
rocket, demonstrated, and re-supplied the space station.
Four years from now, I think we will demonstrate manned
transport. And six years from now, and we'll have our
heavy lift launch vehicle operating.
 BARRY HURD:
03:25:59;20 When are we going to Mars?
 ELON MUSK:
03:26:02;16 When are we going to Mars?
 BARRY HURD:
03:26:05;04 Are you going to Mars?
 ELON MUSK: 
PG.31
03:26:05;22 There's a lot of variability around that prediction.
 BARRY HURD:
03:26:08;05 Is that sort of in the back of your mind somewhere?
 ELON MUSK:
03:26:10;22 Yeah, absolutely.
 BARRY HURD:
03:26:11;12 Tell me just a little bit about why you wanna do that.
 ELON MUSK:
03:26:15;16 Well, first of all, it's not that I, personally, wanna go to
Mars. It's just that, as I said, I think it's extremely
important that life become multi-planetary. And so you
might say well, why do I think it's important? You know,
aren't there lots of important things [happening] on earth
that should be addressed?
03:26:31;12 And certainly there are. And it's not that it's important to
the exclusion of all other things. Just that it makes sense
to spend a small amount of our resources on doing this.
And the reason it's important, is if you go to the nature of
importance itself, how do you decide that anything is 
PG.32
important? Well, the lens of history is a good way to filter
more versus less important things.
03:26:52;22 And as you zoom out further and further the really
important stuff stays and the less important stuff goes
away. Now, let's say you zoom out really far and look at
the entire history of earth or history of life itself. What are
the most important elements in the history of life itself?
03:27:13;15 Forget about parochial concerns of humanity. What would
any species, any intelligent species say: "Oh, those were
really important items?" Well, there's, obviously, single
celled [life], multi cellular life, plants and animals, the
animals you know, [sea-creatures] going out of the ocean
onto land, having mammals, consciousness, [and] this [is]
part of maybe ten or so big ones on that list.
03:27:42;13 And on that list, you, also, fit the extension of life to
multiple planets for the first time. It will be, at least, as
important as life going from the oceans to land and 
PG.33
arguably more important because life could [move]
gradually from the oceans to land and if it got a little
uncomfortable on the beach, you can hop back in the
ocean. But [to] go extending life to another planet is a
huge quantum leap.
03:28:05;22 You have to go hundreds of millions of miles across
extremely hostile environment to a planet which is
completely unlike anything you've evolved to live on. And
that's just really an extremely difficult problem. In fact, I
think it's an impossible problem without the advent of
consciousness. So consciousness is a necessary precursor
for that.
 BARRY HURD:
03:28:29;28 It's almost like part of a grandness. [Do] you think there is
some kind of destiny involved in this? Or is it just physics?
 ELON MUSK:
03:28:38;25 Well, I do. Do I think that there's some sort of master
intelligence architecting all of this stuff? I think probably
not because then you have to say: "Where does the 
PG.34
master intelligence come from?" So it sort of begs the
question. So I think really you can explain this with the
fundamental laws of physics. You know its complex
phenomenon from simple elements.
 BARRY HURD:
03:29:07;21 Let me jump back and ask you. So you wanted this thing
with the Space X, let's become multi- planetary. But you,
also, got involved in the alternate energy [thing] [with] the
electric car. I'm thinking, I guess you got one parked out
front they're telling me.
 ELON MUSK:
03:29:18;18 Yeah.
 BARRY HURD:
04:00:51;01 Tell us a little bit about Tesla, how that started, and what
your goals are for that.
 ELON MUSK:
04:00:55;18 Sure, well, Tesla started with a lunch that I had with J.B.
Straubel and Harold Rosen. Harold Rosen is somebody
who's actually very famous in the space arena and also in
the electric car arena. So that actually was what ended up 
PG.35
being the bridge from rockets to electric cars. Although I,
as I mentioned earlier, had a long standing interest in
electric cars because that's what I originally came out to
California to do grad studies in.
04:01:24;09 So , I had lunch with J.B. and Harold and J.B. mentioned
this company, AC Propulsion, which had this car called the
TZero which was a kit car with lithium ion batteries that
had a 0 to 60 mph and, 250 mile range. So I was, like,
"Yeah, wow, that sounds great." And that sounds about
right because if you go from nickel metal hydride to lithium
ion, you about double the energy density. And the EV1
which was the nickel metal hydride car had had about a
120 mile range. So if you double the energy density,
you're gonna get a 40 mile range or thereabouts.
04:01:55;14 So I got a test drive of the TZero, and I said, "Wow! This
is really great. I tried to encourage AC Propulsion to go
into production with the TZero or productize it essentially.
But they weren't inclined to do that. They're sort of more 
PG.36
of an inventor type shop. They don't like to make product.
So and I tried to get them to even make one for me, and
they wouldn't make one for me.
04:02:21;23 Anyway, but they did end up introducing me to three guys,
Martin Eberhart, Mark Topning, and Ian Wright, who were
interested in productizing the TZero. So I funded the
company and worked with those three guys to develop the
Tesla Roadster. And the design ended up being an
iteration primarily between myself, J.B. Staubel, the guy
I'd had lunch with who joined Tesla right after I funded it,
and Martin Eberhart.
 BARRY HURD:
04:02:57;21 What are some of the things that we, the average person
would look for in models, like sports car models and a
medium price; the price will come down eventually?
Anybody will be able to get an electric car like Tesla or?
 ELON MUSK:
04:03:06;28 Yeah, with the Tesla Roadster, with the sports car, it's a
two-seater sports car, very high performance. It says 
PG.37
super car performance. In fact, it'll beat any Ferrari or
Aston Martin in acceleration. And it has more than twice
the energy efficiency of a Prius. The fully-computer wellto-wheel efficiency taking a gallon of oil and converting
that to generate electricity, taking transmission losses and
charging losses into account, counting how many miles
you get, and taking that gallon of oil and refining it to
gasoline and seeing how many miles you get, that's how
you get the well-to-wheel efficiency.
04:03:39;08 And the Roadster is more than twice as good as a Prius.
But it's $100,000. And the reason is because new
technology takes time to optimize. We're working on a
model two which is a luxury sports sedan, four-door fivepassenger, quite roomy, and that'll go for about half the
price. And then we've got additional products in the queue
which will drop that price by half again and get us to about
a $30,000 car.
 BARRY HURD:
04:04:09;23 Let me jump over to the-- is it Solar City. 
PG.38
 ELON MUSK:
04:04:12;14 Solar City, yeah.
 BARRY HURD:
04:04:14;00 Tell me a little bit about that, how that started, what that's
doing, and how innovation plays a role in that company.
 ELON MUSK:
04:04:18;12 Sure. With Solar City the idea there is to help solve the
production side of electricity. So it's all well and good if
you've got electric cars. But how do you produce the
electricity? So that's why I wanted to do Solar City.
04:04:35;28 And there I have to give a lot of credit to Lyndon Rive and
Peter Rive who are actually my cousins. But they're the
guys making it happen. And although I contributed to the
initial idea, that's really just a small part of the equation.
As Edison said, "It's one percent inspiration, 99 percent
perspiration." And they've just done a phenomenal job on
executing that company and making solar power
affordable. And also it's innovation on so many levels
because there's the insulation and the construction of the 
PG.39
solar power.
04:05:13;04 But then you've also have to say, “Well, how do you make
it so that people don't have to outlay a bunch of money?”
Because solar power is very much a cost of capital type of
business 'cause once you've paid for it, there's no fuel. So
it's really how do you reduce the cost of capital for buying
the thing in the first place. And they've come up with
some very innovative financial tools working with Morgan
Stanley. They set up a $300 million fund that allows
people to establish solar power with no money down. So I
mean how do you like this proposition? You put no money
down, and your electricity bill goes down?
 BARRY HURD:
04:05:48;06 What's not to like?
 ELON MUSK:
04:05:49;00 What's not to like? Exactly. So they're growing like gang
busters.
 BARRY HURD:
04:05:52;05 Elon, let me ask you a question. You've got three 
PG.40
companies going, at least five kids that you know about,
right? That's the joke. What's a typical day like? How do
you juggle all this and keep it going?
 ELON MUSK:
04:06:03;04 It's a little intense. Actually, I'm trying to throttle back
because particularly the triplets are starting to gain
consciousness. They're, you know, almost two. And well,
before kids gain consciousness, they don't really know if
you're there or not. I mean they know that people are
there. They recognize familiar faces, but they don't know,
and they don't have expectations that Dad will be home at
a certain time. The twins do. They're four.
 BARRY HURD:
04:06:27;04 You have triplets and twins?
 ELON MUSK:
04:06:27;27 Yeah, all boys. So I definitely have to scale down my work
activity within…I think I've got no more than a year.
 BARRY HURD:
04:06:37;16 But you spend, I mean between these three big things
going on now, is most of it here at SpaceX or is it, I mean 
PG.41
where do you do your work day, where are you putting
[in] most of the time I guess?
 ELON MUSK:
04:06:47;20 It does vary. So I mean right now I'm probably 60/40, or
60 percent SpaceX, 40 percent Tesla. Well, actually
probably, 60 percent SpaceX, 35 percent Tesla, and five
percent Solar City and everything else. So most of my
time is really split primarily between SpaceX and Solar
City. Long term I'd like to reduce the total number of
hours worked and to be roughly 25 percent Solar City,
sorry, 25 percent Tesla, maybe…
 BARRY HURD:
04:07:24;08 Change the ratio?
 ELON MUSK:
04:07:22;07 Yeah, change the ratio to be a little more weighted in favor
of SpaceX 'cause I wasn't expecting to spend so much time
with Tesla. And then also just to reduce the total number
of hours so I have more time to spend with my kids.
 BARRY HURD:
04:07:35;24 [With] all three of these endeavors there's a commonality 
PG.42
of this innovation in putting the people together and the
teams and seeing things in a different way. Tell me a little
bit more about the philosophy of how you make that all
work, how you attract the people, and how you manage it.
You talk about the first principles of physics. Do you
actually apply the principles of physics to your
philosophical thinking of how to do this? Or, take me into
that realm.
 ELON MUSK:
04:08:00;18 Well, what does the phrase “reason from first principles”
mean in physics? It means that you go to the very basic
laws of physics, the things to which we believe to be
extremely well demonstrated. In other words, the reason
they call it a law is that no one has ever demonstrated an
exception to that, ever. That's how it qualifies as being a
law.
04:08:26;28 But even then, laws can be broken where you can find
some corner case in a very unusual circumstance that will
break it. And that's the transition from Newtonian to 
PG.43
Einsteinian mechanics. Newtonian mechanics are actually
extremely predictive of reality except as you approach the
speed of light. Since, you know, back in the day with their
primitive instruments, they couldn't detect these tiny little
differences. So you know Newtonian mechanics appeared
to predict everything perfectly.
04:08:59;23 But you take these very fundamental laws and you say,
"Now let's use those as the ingredients from which we will
construct a conclusion, a theory. 'Cause we know that
base is sound, and we, so, therefore, if we're able to
combine those elements in a way that's cogent, that
conclusion will be sound. That's what I mean by reason
and conclusive first principles. And I think that general
approach can be taken in many fields.
 BARRY HURD:
04:09:28;01 And how do you translate that to getting the right people
to think that way, to these breakthrough ways of thinking
of these innovations that go on? 
PG.44
 ELON MUSK:
04:09:38;19 Well, getting the right people is extremely important. And
I actually interview everyone at SpaceX personally. And
we're a 500 person company. So that's a lot of interviews.
 BARRY HURD:
04:09:51;14 What do you look for in someone?
 ELON MUSK:
04:09:53;23 What do I look for? It depends on the task. You know, it's
different, and I’m not necessarily looking for someone who
has brilliant analytical ability if their job is going to be
assembling hardware. But I think, generally, I look for a
positive attitude and are they easy to work with, are
people gonna like working with them? It's very important
to like the people you work with, otherwise life [and] your
job is gonna be quite miserable. And, in fact, we have a
(CLEARS THROAT) a strict “no-assholes policy” at SpaceX.
And we fire people if they are. I mean, we give them a
little bit of warning. But if they continue to be an asshole,
then they're fired. 
PG.45
 BARRY HURD:
04:10:35;28 That's innovative, right?
 ELON MUSK:
04:10:36;29 Yeah. Because you know, if your boss is an awful person,
you're gonna hate coming to work.
 BARRY HURD:
04:10:45;26 Yeah, you said something earlier about how, I forgot
exactly the term, but how the United States is a great
place to innovate.
 ELON MUSK:
04:10:49;19 Yeah.
 BARRY HURD:
04:10:49;12 Tell me a little bit. I know you must be really proAmerican for innovation. Tell me how the way the U.S.
has set up works that advantage for people like you.
 ELON MUSK:
04:10:59;19 Well, I think the United States is more open to new ideas
than any country in the world. And I think becomes
somewhat of a self-fulfilling prophecy in that because the
United States is open to new ideas, it attracted people 
PG.46
from around the world who had new ideas. And so it
becomes, you know, so now it's filled with people who like
new ideas. And who aren't bound by history.
04:11:29;04 You know, a lot of the countries that have been around for
a long time are really trapped in their own history. And
the United States is also a great melting pot of different
cultures and ideas and thoughts and it's a country which
tends to encourage success, where you sort of see
someone that did extremely well, and generally, the
reaction of the United States is good for that person.
04:11:52;10 In most [other] countries, it may shock people in the
United States. In most [other] countries, that's not the
reaction. People tend to think, "Oh, that person did well
because they screwed somebody else." Or they try to rise
beyond their station [and] that was really inappropriate of
them to be nouveau riche, to use a French word. And
Australia, for example, which is arguably similar to the
United States in a lot of ways, but they tend to not, they 
PG.47
tend to try to knock down people that have risen too high.
They're called the tall-poppy syndrome. You know, tall
poppies get shot. So I think that's really a good thing
about the United States.
 BARRY HURD:
04:12:36;25 Tell me a little bit about what you think about people.
[Do] you think ordinary people can change the world if
they're given the right resources? Or, like you started out,
you're basically an ordinary guy, but you're changing the
world in a way, aren't ya?
 ELON MUSK:
04:12:48;26 Well, you have to look at it, what's the definition of an
ordinary person? I probably wasn't that ordinary. But my
lack of ordinariness did not manifest itself until later in life.
Or wasn't all that obvious. But I think people can choose
to be not ordinary. You know, they can choose to not
necessarily conform to the conventions that were taught to
them by their parents. So, yes, I think it's possible for
ordinary people to choose to be extraordinary. 
PG.48
 BARRY HURD:
04:13:23;07 Now, let me ask you. Did you have mentors? Or was it
your parents that were your inspiration, [or] an older
brother? I mean what sort of drove you from that
standpoint from looking up [to someone], [and] was there
anybody you looked up to?
 ELON MUSK:
04:13:36;09 Well I think on like Wikipedia it says that I was inspired by
my father in terms of technology. This is actually not true.
I think that needs to be corrected. He's somewhat of a
Luddite actually in many respects, and particularly
computers. He didn't wanna buy a computer and refused
to use computers and said they would never amount to
anything.
04:13:55;16 So I actually had to buy a computer with saved up
[money]; I saved up my allowance. And he did contribute
a bit after I saved up my allowance. But he initially
refused to buy a computer for me. But he was an
engineer, an electrical and mechanical engineer. So I was 
PG.49
exposed to technical subjects when I was growing up. It’s
just that he wasn't much of a technologist. As far as role
models, I think there's obviously somebody, the obvious
role models. I think Edison was certainly a role model
probably one of the biggest role models.
 BARRY HURD:
04:14:32;02 Did you study Edison's life?
 ELON MUSK:
04:14:33;16 Yeah, I read books about him, absolutely. And it's an
interesting contrast like Edison versus Tesla. The car
company is called Tesla. And the reason it's called Tesla is
because we use an AC induction motor, which is an
architecture that Tesla developed. And the guy probably
deserves a little more play than he gets in current society.
04:14:52;16 But on balance, I'm a bigger fan of Edison than Tesla
because Edison brought his stuff to market and made
those inventions accessible to the world, whereas Tesla
didn't really do that. So he would certainly be a big one.
And you know, I think the great technologists--Steve Jobs 
PG.50
at Apple, Bill Gates. I actually thought Disney was a pretty
good innovator. I like Disney, yeah.
 BARRY HURD:
04:15:30;06 Well, I mean you're gonna be in that role or you already
are. How do you inspire people? I mean do you, what do
you do to inspire people around here?
 ELON MUSK:
04:15:36;17 What do I do to inspire people? Well, I try to make it a
really fun place to work, really enjoyable. And I talk about
the grand vision of SpaceX, where we wanna go, what we
wanna do; we wanna take people to orbit and beyond. We
ultimately want to be the company that makes a difference
in extension of life beyond earth, which is one of the most
important things that life itself could achieve. And so sort
of you construct this great Holy Grail potential in the
future. You have to stay grounded in the short term.
'Cause if you don't do things that pay the bills you're not
gonna achieve the ultimate long-term objective. But it's
nice to have that sort of Holy Grail long term potential out
there as inspiration for coming to work. 
PG.51
 BARRY HURD:
04:16:32;08 Yeah, I mean you're motivated obviously to make money.
But and you wanna make money. But are you motivated
beyond just profit motive and racking up dollars?
 ELON MUSK:
04:16:41;13 Yeah, no, I'm a volunteer. I mean I don't need the
money. There's nothing [I want to buy]. It’s not like I'm
sitting here saying, "I wish I could buy such and such a
thing." I could buy it. I get paid minimum wage.
Actually, I don't even get overtime. So but not being
motivated, personally, by money is not the same as saying
that I think SpaceX shouldn't make money. In fact, it's
very important that SpaceX is profitable, or we'll not be
able to earn the money necessary to continue future
developments because the company’s at a scale right now
where I can't afford to just personally fund it and not get
any [return], and we don't generate any revenue. We
have to sort of earn our keep 'cause we're a pretty big
company right now. 
PG.52
 BARRY HURD:
04:17:23;00 So you gotta be financially healthy.
 ELON MUSK:
04:17:24;12 Right, so SpaceX has to be financially healthy in that the
cost of what we produce has to be less than the price that
we charge people, or we'll all go into the ground.
 BARRY HURD:
04:17:37;26 What qualities do you think it takes to create the stuff that
makes innovative thinking happen?
 BARRY HURD:
04:17:39;02 What qualities do you think it takes to create innovative
thinking? What's some of the stuff that makes innovative
thinking happen?
 ELON MUSK:
04:17:45;00 Some stuff that [makes innovative thinking happen?]
Okay. What makes innovative thinking happen? Well, I
think it's really a mindset. You have to decide. We're
going to try to do things differently. Well, provided that
they're better. You shouldn't do things differently just
because they're different. They need to be different or 
PG.53
better. But I think you have to sort of decide. Let's think
beyond the normal stuff and have an environment where
that sort of thinking in encouraged and rewarded and
where it's okay to fail as well. Because when you try new
things, you try this idea, that idea. Well, a large number
of them are not gonna work, and that has to be okay. If
every time somebody comes up with an idea it has to be
successful, you're not gonna get people coming up with
ideas.
 BARRY HURD:
04:18:28;13 Do you think a lot of people in companies make mistakes
and discourage people from being innovative? I mean if
you were to give a message to people who wanna be an
innovator and maybe come up with [new ideas], and
maybe you're one of their inspirations, what would you tell
the people, the young kids now who are thinking of
creating the future?
 ELON MUSK:
04:18:49;08 Could you say that again” 
PG.54
 BARRY HURD:
04:18:49;22 I said, what would you tell young people who are starting
out now who wanna help create the future, wanna be
innovative?
 ELON MUSK:
04:18:54;22 Yeah.
 BARRY HURD:
04:18:55;04 What sort of things should they be thinking about or
doing? And [what is] your message to the next generation
that's coming up?
 ELON MUSK:
04:19:01;14 Well, it's like the Nike slogan. You know, just do it. Just
showing up is half the battle. You gotta try hard to do it,
and don't be afraid of failure. You also need to be rooted
in reality. It's easy to get high on your own supply. It's as
Scar Face said, “you've gotta not be afraid to innovate”,
but also don't delude yourself into thinking something's
working when it's not, or you're gonna get fixated on a bad
solution. 
PG.55
04:19:43;01 Yeah, and I think also just don't be afraid of new arenas.
You know, you can get a book. You can learn something
and experiment with your hands and just make it happen.
Find a way or make a way to get something done. I don't
know if that's helpful.
04:19:57;28
 BARRY HURD:
04:20:13;11 Is there anything about Henry Ford's life that you studied
or paid attention to that [might have influenced you]?
 ELON MUSK:
04:20:16;00 Oh, well, yeah, absolutely.
04:20:17;09
 ELON MUSK:
04:20:21;29 Yeah, actually there's a lot of things about Ford that I think
are really interesting. He's often associated, obviously,
with the moving production line. That was a big
innovation. But Ford was just the kinda guy that when
something was in the way, he just found a way around it.
He just got it done. He was also big on vertical
integration, which I actually think is good. In [the] modern 
PG.56
world, people have started to think that vertical integration
is bad. I think Ford was right that you do wanna be
vertically integrated. Not to a silly degree, but you do
wanna be vertically integrated.
04:21:02;15 I think it's good to combine engineering and production.
So have development and production close together
because when you try to make something there's a big
leap between making that first prototype and actually
making it, manufacturing it in large quantity with good
quality. It's really hard to make that leap. And for some
reason people decide, “oh, they're gonna do engineering
here and do the manufacturing on the other side of the
world.” And I think that actually ends up being, often
being pretty inefficient. I like that combination of
engineering and production.
04:21:43;26 What else is there? You know, Ford, at least in the
beginning of his career, I think he got a little too high on
his own supply later in his career, or Ford would have 
PG.57
remained the largest car company in the world. But at
least the beginning of his career, he actually was really
focused on what the customer wanted. What the customer
needed. And sometimes the customer doesn't actually
know what they need. But he really figured it out. Like, if
we can make this car really affordable, reliable, something
that finally [someone] can depend on their livelihood for,
man, that's really gonna make a difference in people's
lives. And he just really got focused on that.
04:22:25;06 Now, over time, he should have decided, okay, sometimes
people want a color that's not black. And so he should
provide that to them. But at least in the beginning of his
career, he just had tremendous insight into what would
really make a difference as a product.
 BARRY HURD:
04:22:39;18 And a final question. When this capsule behind you is
ready, you goin' up?
 ELON MUSK:
04:22:45;11 I will eventually go to space, yes.

 BARRY HURD:
04:22:47;25 So that's part of a serious plan?

 ELON MUSK:
04:22:54;28 I do wanna go to space and eventually it would be really
cool if I could go to Mars. That would be super awesome.
But this is not about me getting to space, it's really about
enabling others to get to space. It's about enabling the
extension of life beyond earth. So I'd like to go in the first
one. Actually, if I didn't have all these [projects], so much
depending on me, I would, actually.
04:23:19;28 You know, early in life, I did lots of risky things when I
didn't have that much that was depending on me. Now I
have to be more cautious about risky things. But
eventually I will definitely go up.
